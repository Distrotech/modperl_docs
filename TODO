# things to do for mod_perl site infrastructure

Basic Layout:
-------------

- NS4, if PRE is long the page is scrolled to the right! See
  dst_html/docs/2.0/devel/debug_c/debug_c.html#Analyzing_the_core_File
  STATUS: currently we try to live with that

DocSet:
-------

- how do we make L<foo|../search/swish.cgi> I cannot do search::swish,
  it's not a doc.
  STATUS: need to extend pod parser with U<title (url|relative url)>

- need to have a special handling for L<...|foo::bar::index> so only
  foo::bar is checked that it's a dir in the search path and
  index.html is autogenerated. This allows us to do L<the
  guide|guide::index>
  STATUS: need to implement this

Menu: 
-----

style.css:
----------

Templates:
----------

- consider passing the class name to the wrap_box template, so the
  'content' doesn't have to wrap itself in a <div> tag. If class is
  passed then we can use it in <td class="">
  STATUS: low priority

General:
--------

- Need to document the font-type and -size used for the image button,
  so in the future we can add new buttons of the same style if needed.
  STATUS: waiting for input from Allan

Content:
--------

- need to make the content review and adjust config.cfg files to
  provide good abstracts. The same goes for src html files -- should
  use the <meta name="description" value=""> to add abstracts here.

- src/about/help.pod, should be completed

- how about adding a page: 'link to us', with a selection of a few
  logos/buttons for people to reuse, including a copy-n-paste-ready
  HTML fetching the logo. Though we probably want people to copy the
  images rather than linking to perl.apache.org to fetch the
  image. Could probably go into About section, which can be split into
  a few pages, making About a DocSet.

- add to the success stories: http://perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/17/etoys.html

- ask perl.com to link to perl.apache.org from 'perl sites' section.
  + also they need to add theperlreview.com

- need to review the old site and add new rewrite rules for important
  resources that have moved.

- check that 404.html actually works.

Search:
-------

 - consider adding auto-focus feature:

  <body background="[% doc.dir.abs_doc_root %]/images/bgline.gif"
  bgcolor="#ffffff" onLoad="document.forms[0].elements[0].focus()">

  make sure that this won't create js errors, on pages without
  document.forms[0]
  STATUS: on hold

====================================================================

Later:
------

- Think about porting the conferences stuff

- add feather in the tail
<img src="[% doc.dir.abs_doc_root %]/images/feather_transbg.gif" width=194 height=80 alt="ASF feather">
