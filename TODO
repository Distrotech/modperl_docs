# things to do for mod_perl site infrastructure

Basic Layout:
-------------

- NS4, if PRE is long the page is scrolled to the right! See
  dst_html/docs/2.0/devel/debug_c/debug_c.html#Analyzing_the_core_File

- in Mozilla, there are no borders around the NavBar tables, whereas with IE
  and Opera, there are. which way is correct/better?

- with Opera and IE, there is too little spacing between the ads. Maybe add
  a br or &nbsp; may be not?

- there are empty prev/up/next boxes on the main page, looking sort of
  strange. shoulf we remove those completly, if there is no UP or use
  really-empty images as placeholders?

- since we have <hr> before the tail on all pages, we don't need the
  &nbsp; x 300 hack, since hr will ensure that the page will always
  span 100% to the right. the local_nav table also spans 100%. But
  need to test this first.

DocSet:
-------

Menu: 
-----

- Need to try to make the menu smaller

Internal links:
--------------_

- links (e.g. in src/docs/1.0/guide) aren't hyperlinked yet.

style.css:
----------

- the pdf/src images are a little bit too big vertically, so if some
  pages don't have this icon the bar following the title jumps.

- how do we make [prev|up|next] widget do the same as <td NOWRAP>?

Templates:
----------

- consider passing the class name to the wrap_box template, so the
  'content' doesn't have to wrap itself in a <div> tag. If class is
  passed then we can use it in <td class="">

- currently we have (page_no(prev|parent|next).gif which don't have
  the text on the them. We need this to make sure that the widget
  doesn't move left/right when there is no prev or next, or
  parent. But it doesn't look nice. Consider to use completely empty
  images which will just be of the same size (spacer image?). Not sure
  though.

Content:
--------

- need to make the content review and adjust config.cfg files to
  provide good abstracts. The same goes for src html files -- should
  use the <meta name="description" value=""> to add abstracts here.

- src/about/help.pod, should be completed

- how about adding a page: 'link to us', with a selection of a few
  logos/buttons for people to reuse, including a copy-n-paste-ready
  HTML fetching the logo. Though we probably want people to copy the
  images rather than linking to perl.apache.org to fetch the
  image. Could probably go into About section, which can be split into
  a few pages, making About a DocSet.

Search:
-------

- make the search return hits linked to the sections, not pages

- make the indices for each docset. So users will be able to search
  sub-sets from the page they are on. No need for making indices for
  single pages, since it doesn't add an added value, users have a
  search function in the browser. However this could make sense if the
  engine returns links to the sub-sections of the page.

  the 'search' template needs to be adjusted to link to these
  sub-indices.

- can we make the returned preview of the hits preserve the structure?
  e.g. searching for 'strict' finds lost of code examples, but the
  <pre> formatting is lost. So it's harder to make a good use of these
  previews.

- can we take the swish-e further and instead of linking to the static
  matching page, link to a page created dynamically, by taking the
  static page and highlighting the matched words, similar to google's
  cache?

====================================================================

Later:
------

- Think about porting the conferences stuff

- add <link REL="shortcut icon" HREF="/favicon.ico" TYPE="image/x-icon">
+ favicon.ico (need to make one, something like [mp]?
