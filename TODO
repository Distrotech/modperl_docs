# things to do for mod_perl site infrastructure

- Basic

 o NS4, cannot make bg-image to render

 o NS4, this pages is messed up: dst_html/download/bundles.html

- Menu: 

  o Need to try to make the menu smaller

- Internal links (e.g. in src/docs/1.0/guide) aren't hyperlinked.

- Think about porting the conferences stuff

- src/creation.html, should be completed and linked from somewhere
  (the tail?)

style.css:

- consider using: font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;

Templates:

- consider passing the class name to the wrap_box template, so the
  'content' doesn't have to wrap itself in a <div> tag. If class is
  passed then we can use it in <td class="">
