- Basic

 o The ads crash NS4 (any version)

- Menu: 

  o Need to try to make the menu smaller

- Navigation

  o The 'TOP' image should be made using the same colors as other

- Internal links (e.g. in src/docs/1.0/guide) aren't hyperlinked.

- Think about porting the conferences stuff

- /src/creation.html, should be completed and linked from somewhere
