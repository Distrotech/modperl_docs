# things to do for mod_perl site infrastructure

- Menu: 

  o the current page's item is hyperlinked (it's not clear if it
    shouldn't be as it helps navigation, since the menu opens only the
    first level and it allows to go all the way up )

  o Need to try to make the menu smaller

- Navigation

  o The 'TOP' image should be made using the same colors as other
    widgets.

- Internal links (e.g. in src/docs/1.0/guide) aren't hyperlinked.

- Think about porting the conferences stuff

- /src/creation.html, should be completed and linked from somewhere
  (the tail?)
