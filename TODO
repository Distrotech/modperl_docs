# things to do for mod_perl site infrastructure

- Basic

 o NS4, cannot make bg-image to render

 o NS4, this pages is messed up: dst_html/download/bundles.html

 o NS4, if PRE is long the page is scrolled to the right! See
   dst_html/docs/2.0/devel/debug_c/debug_c.html#Analyzing_the_core_File

- Menu: 

  o Need to try to make the menu smaller

- Internal links (e.g. in src/docs/1.0/guide) aren't hyperlinked.

- src/about/help.html, should be completed

style.css:

- consider using: font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;

Templates:

- consider passing the class name to the wrap_box template, so the
  'content' doesn't have to wrap itself in a <div> tag. If class is
  passed then we can use it in <td class="">

- currently we have (page_no(prev|parent|next).gif which don't have
  the text on the them. We need this to make sure that the widget
  doesn't move left/right when there is no prev or next, or
  parent. But it doesn't look nice. Consider to use completely empty
  images which will just be of the same size (spacer image?). Not sure
  though.

Later:

- Think about porting the conferences stuff
