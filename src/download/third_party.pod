Additional Software

=head1 Description

Where to get software written by other parties that might be useful
(or necessary) when running mod_perl.

=head1 Perl

Perl is probably already installed on your machine, but you should at
least check the version you are using.  It is highly recommended that
you have at least Perl version 5.004.  You can get the latest perl
version from http://cpan.org/src/.  Try the direct download link
http://cpan.org/src/stable.tar.gz.  You can get Perl documentation
from the same location (although copious documentation is included in
the downloaded Perl distribution).

=head1 CPAN Downloads

You can download most of the Perl modules from CPAN.  There are many
mirrors of this site.  The main site's URL is http://cpan.org/.

You may want to search the Perl modules database by using
http://search.cpan.org/.

Either use the search form, or type in the name of the package the
module is distributed in. For example if you are looking for
C<Apache::DumpHeaders>, you can type:
http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Apache-DumpHeaders .

=head1 Apache

Get the latest Apache webserver and documentation from
http://httpd.apache.org.  Try the direct download link
http://httpd.apache.org/dist/.

=head1 Squid - Internet Object Cache

http://www.squid-cache.org/

Squid Linux 2.x Redhat RPMs : http://home.earthlink.net/~intrep/linux/

=head1 thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server

http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/

=head1 mod_throttle_access 

http://www.fremen.org/apache/mod_throttle_access.html

=head1 mod_proxy_add_forward

Ask Bjoern Hansen has written the C<mod_proxy_add_forward.c> module
for Apache that sets the C<X-Forwarded-For> field when doing a
ProxyPass, similar to what Squid does.  His module is available from
one of these URLs: http://modules.apache.org/,
http://develooper.com/code/mpaf/mod_proxy_add_forward.c or
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ABH/mod_proxy_add_forward.c, complete
with instructions on how to compile it and whatnot.

=head1 Flood -- another webserver Benchmarking tool

=head1 ab -- ApacheBench

ApacheBench comes with the Apache distribution.

=head1 Daquiri -- yet another webserver Benchmarking tool

should be available from the mod_backhand CVS tree:

=head1 High-Availability and Load Balancing Projects

=head2 mod_backhand -- Load Balancing for Apache

http://www.backhand.org/mod_backhand/

=head2 mod_redundancy

mod_redundancy is a module that works with Apache webserver. It
creates a Master/Slave Relationship between two physical
webservers. The Slave takes over the IP-Address(es) and the
Webservice(s) in case of a failure of the Master. One of the clues of
this solution is, that the Redundancy/Failover-Configuration is made
inside the Apache-Configfile.

The product is neither OSS, nor free :(

The homepage of mod_redundancy is http://www.ask-the-guru.com .

=head2 Efficient Support for P-HTTP in Cluster-Based Web Servers

(with Mohit Aron and Willy Zwaenepoel.) In Proceedings of the USENIX
1999 Annual Technical Conference, Monterey, CA, June 1999.

=head2 IP Filter

The latest ip filter includes some simple load balancing code, that
allows a round-robin distribution onto several machines via
ipnat. That may be a simple solution for a few specific load problem.
