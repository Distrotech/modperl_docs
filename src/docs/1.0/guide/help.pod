Getting Help

=head1 Description

If your question isn't answered by reading this guide, check this section
for information on how to get help on mod_perl, Apache, or other topics
discussed here.

=head1 READ ME FIRST

If, after reading this guide, the L<general docs|docs::general::index>
and the L<other documents|docs::offsite::index> listed on this site,
you still don't have the answers, please ask for help on the
L<mod_perl users mailing list|maillist::modperl>.  But please, first
try to browse the L<mailing list
archive|maillist::modperl/Searchable_Archives>.  Most of the time
you will find the answers to your questions by searching the archive,
since it is very likely that someone else has already encountered the
same problem and found a solution for it.  If you ignore this advice,
you should not be surprised if your question is left unanswered -- it
bores people to answer the same question again and again.  This does
not mean that you should avoid asking questions, but you should not
abuse the available help and you should I<RTFM> before you call for
I<HELP>.  (Remember the fable of the shepherd boy and the wolves).

Another possibilty is to look in the general L<Getting
Help|help::index> section of this site for a commercial training or
consulting company.

=head2 Please Ask Only Questions Related to mod_perl

If you have general Apache questions, please refer to:
http://httpd.apache.org/lists.html.

If you have general Perl questions, please refer to:
http://lists.perl.org/.

For other remotely related to mod_perl questions see the references to
L<other documentation|docs::offsite::other>.

Finally, if you are posting to the list for the first time, please
refer to the mod_perl mailing lists'
L<Guidelines|maillist::email-etiquette>.

=head1 How to Report Problems

Make sure to include a good subject like explaining the problem in a
few words. Also please mention that this a problem with mod_perl 1.0
(since now we have mod_perl 2.0 too). Here is an example of a good
subject:

  Subject: [mp1] response handler randomly segfaults

B<The most important thing> to understand is that you should try hard
to provide B<all> the information that may assist to understand and
reproduce the problem. When you prepare a bug report, put yourself in
the position of a person who is going to try to help you, realizing
that a guess-work on behalf of that helpful person, more often doesn't
work than it does. Unfortunately most people don't realize that, and
it takes several emails to squeeze the needed details from the person
reporting the bug, a process which may drag for days.

Always send the following details:

=over

=item *

Anything in the I<error_log> file that looks suspicious and possibly
related to the problem.

=item *

Output of C<perl -V>

=item *

Version of mod_perl (hint: it's logged into the error_log file when
the server has just started)

=item *

Version of apache (hint: it's logged into the error_log file when the
server has just started)

=item *

Options given to mod_perl's Makefile.PL while building it. If you are
using a pre-compiled binary (e.g., rpm), find the source package that
was used to build this binary and retrieve this information from
there.

=item *

Server configuration details (that's the relevant parts of your
I<httpd.conf>, usually just the relevant mod_perl configuration
sections).

=item *

Relevant sections of your C<ErrorLog> (make test's is: t/logs/error_log)

=item *

If some other code doesn't work, minimize that code to a minimal size
while it reproduces the problem and attach it to the report.

=item *

If you build from source, make sure that C<make test> passes 100%.

If C<make test> fails, run the failing tests L<separately, using the
verbose mode|docs::1.0::guide::install/Manual_Testing> and attach the
output of the run and the relevant sections of your C<ErrorLog> to the
report.

=back

If this is a script which doesn't use mod_perl api, try to test under
mod_cgi if applicable

You should try to isolate the problem and send the smallest possible
code snippet, that reproduces the problem.

Remember, that if we cannot reproduce the problem, we might not be
able to solve it.

=item Getting the Backtrace From Core Dumps

If you get a I<core> file dump (I<Segmentation fault>), please send a
backtrace if possible.  Before you try to produce it, re-build
mod_perl with:

  panic% perl Makefile.PL PERL_DEBUG=1

which will:

=over

=item * add C<-g> to C<EXTRA_CFLAGS>

=item * turn on C<PERL_TRACE>

=item * set C<PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2> (additional checks during Perl cleanup)

=item * link against I<libperld> if it exists

=back

Here is a summary of how to get a backtrace:

  % cd mod_perl-x.xx
  % touch t/conf/srm.conf
  % gdb ../apache_x.xx/src/httpd
  (gdb) run -X -f `pwd`/t/conf/httpd.conf -d `pwd`/t
  [now make request that causes core dump]
  (gdb) bt

So you go to the mod_perl source directory, create an empty
I<srm.conf> file, and start gdb with a path to the httpd binary, which
is at least located in the Apache source tree after you built it. (Of
course replace I<x> with real version numbers). Next step is to start
the httpd from within gdb and issue a request, which causes a core
dump. when the code has died with SEGV sygnal, run I<bt> to get the
backtrace.

Alternatively you can also attach to an already running process like
so:

  % gdb httpd <process id number>

If the dump is happening in I<libperl> you have to rebuild Perl with
C<-DDEBUGGING> enabled. A quick way to this is to go to your Perl
source tree and run these commands:

  % rm *.[oa]
  % make LIBPERL=libperld.a
  % cp libperld.a $Config{archlibexp}/CORE

where C<$Config{archlibexp}> is:

  % perl -V:archlibexp

If the trace includes Apache calls and you see no arguments, you need
to rebuild Apache with I<--without-execstrip>. If building a static
mod_perl, you need to rebuild it with:

  % perl Makefile.PL ... APACI_ARGS='--without-execstrip'


=item Spinning Processes

The gdb attaching to the live process approach is helpful when
debugging a I<spinning> process.  You can also get a Perl stacktrace
of a I<spinning> process by install a C<$SIG{USR1}> handler in your
code:

  use Carp ();
  $SIG{USR1} = \&Carp::confess;

While the process is spinning, send it a I<USR1> signal:

  % kill -USR1 <process id number>

and the Perl stack trace will be printed.

alternatively you can use gdb to find which Perl code is causing the
spin:

  % gdb httpd <pid of spinning process>
  (gdb) where
  (gdb) source mod_perl-x.xx/.gdbinit
  (gdb) curinfo

After loading the special macros file (I<.gdbinit>) you can use the
I<curinfo> gdb macro to figure out the file and line number the code
stuck in.

=back

Finally send all these details to the modperl mailing list.

=head1 Help on Related Topics

When developing with mod_perl, you often find yourself having
questions regarding other projects and topics like Apache, Perl, SQL,
etc. L<This document|docs::offsite::other> will help you find the
right resource where you can find the answers to your questions.
