=head1 Warnings

You should be aware of the issues relating to using constant
subroutines in Perl. For example, look at this example:

  $r->custom_response(FORBIDDEN => "File size exceeds quota.");

This will not set a custom response for C<FORBIDDEN>, but for the
string C<"FORBIDDEN">, which clearly isn't what is expected. You'll
get an error like this:

  [Tue Apr 23 19:46:14 2002] null: Argument "FORBIDDEN" isn't numeric in subroutine entry at ...

Therefore, you can avoid this by not using the hash notation for
things that don't require it.

  $r->custom_response(FORBIDDEN,  "File size exceeds quota.");

Another important note is that you should be using the correct
constants defined here, and not direct HTTP codes. For example:

  sub handler {
      return 200;
  }

Is not correct. The correct use is:

  use Apache::Constants qw(OK);
  
  sub handler {
      return OK;
  }

Also remember that C<OK != HTTP_OK>.
