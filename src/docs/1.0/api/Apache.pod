=head1 NAME

Apache - Perl interface to the Apache server API

=head1 Synopsis

   use Apache ();

=head1 Description

This module provides a Perl interface the Apache API.  It is here
mainly for B<mod_perl>, but may be used for other Apache modules that
wish to embed a Perl interpreter.  We suggest that you also consult
the description of the Apache C API at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ .

=head1 The Request Object

The request object holds all the information that the server needs to
service a request.  Apache B<Perl*Handler>s will be given a reference to
the request object as parameter and may choose to update or use it in
various ways.  Most of the methods described below obtain information
from or update the request object.
The perl version of the request object will be blessed into the B<Apache> 
package, it is really a C<request_rec*> in disguise.

=head2 Apache-E<gt>request([$r])

The C<Apache-E<gt>request> method will return a reference to the request
object.

B<Perl*Handler>s can obtain a reference to the request object when it
is passed to them via C<@_>.  However, scripts that run under 
B<Apache::Registry>, for example, need a way to access the request object.
B<Apache::Registry> will make a request object available to these scripts
by passing an object reference to C<Apache-E<gt>request($r)>.
If handlers use modules such as B<CGI::Apache> that need to access
C<Apache-E<gt>request>, they too should do this (e.g. B<Apache::Status>).

=head2 $r-E<gt>as_string

Returns a string representation of the request object.  Mainly useful
for debugging.

=head2 $r-E<gt>main

If the current request is a sub-request, this method returns a blessed
reference to the main request structure.  If the current request is
the main request, then this method returns C<undef>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>prev

This method returns a blessed reference to the previous (internal) request
structure or C<undef> if there is no previous request.

=head2 $r-E<gt>next

This method returns a blessed reference to the next (internal) request
structure or C<undef> if there is no next request.

=head2 $r-E<gt>last

This method returns a blessed reference to the last (internal) request
structure.  Handy for logging modules.

=head2 $r-E<gt>is_main

Returns true if the current request object is for the main request.
(Should give the same result as C<!$r-E<gt>main>, but will be more
efficient.) 

=head2 $r-E<gt>is_initial_req

Returns true if the current request is the first internal request,
returns false if the request is a sub-request or internal redirect.

=head2 $r-E<gt>allowed($bitmask)

Get or set the allowed methods bitmask. This allowed bitmask should be
set whenever a 405 (method not allowed) or 501 (method not implemented)
answer is returned. The bit corresponding to the method number should be
set.

   unless ($r->method_number == M_GET) {
     $r->allowed($r->allowed | (1<<M_GET) | (1<<M_HEAD) | (1<<M_OPTIONS));
     return HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
   }


=head1 Sub Requests

Apache provides a sub-request mechanism to lookup a uri or filename,
performing all access checks, etc., without actually running the
response phase of the given request.  Notice, we have dropped the
C<sub_req_> prefix here.  The C<request_rec*> returned by the lookup
methods is blessed into the B<Apache::SubRequest> class.  This way,
C<destroy_sub_request()> is called automatically during
C<Apache::SubRequest-E<gt>DESTROY> when the object goes out of scope.  The
B<Apache::SubRequest> class inherits all the methods from the
B<Apache> class.


=head2 $r-E<gt>lookup_uri($uri)

   my $subr = $r->lookup_uri($uri);
   my $filename = $subr->filename;

   unless(-e $filename) {
       warn "can't stat $filename!\n";
   } 

=head2 $r-E<gt>lookup_file($filename)

   my $subr = $r->lookup_file($filename);

=head2 $subr-E<gt>run

   if($subr->run != OK) {
       $subr->log_error("something went wrong!");
   }


=head1 Client Request Parameters

In this section we will take a look at various methods that can be used to
retrieve the request parameters sent from the client.
In the following examples, C<$r> is a request object blessed into the 
B<Apache> class, obtained by the first parameter passed to a handler
subroutine or I<Apache-E<gt>request>


=head2 $r-E<gt>method( [$meth] )

The C<$r-E<gt>method> method will return the request method.  It will be a
string such as C<"GET">, C<"HEAD"> or C<"POST">.
Passing an argument will set the method, mainly used for internal
redirects.

=head2 $r-E<gt>method_number( [$num] )

The C<$r-E<gt>method_number> method will return the request method number.
The method numbers are defined by the C<M_GET>, C<M_POST>,... constants
available from the B<Apache::Constants> module.  Passing an argument
will set the C<method_number>, mainly used for internal redirects and
testing authorization restriction masks.

=head2 $r-E<gt>bytes_sent

The number of bytes sent to the client, handy for logging, etc.

=head2 $r-E<gt>the_request

The request line sent by the client, handy for logging, etc.

=head2 $r-E<gt>proxyreq

Returns true if the request is proxy http.
Mainly used during the filename translation stage of the request, 
which may be handled by a C<PerlTransHandler>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>header_only

Returns true if the client is asking for headers only, 
e.g. if the request method was B<HEAD>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>protocol

The C<$r-E<gt>protocol> method will return a string identifying the
protocol that the client speaks.  Typical values will be C<"HTTP/1.0"> or
C<"HTTP/1.1">.

=head2 $r-E<gt>hostname

Returns the server host name, as set by full URI or C<Host:> header.

=head2 $r-E<gt>request_time

Returns the time that the request was made.  The time is the local unix
time in seconds since the epoch.

=head2 $r-E<gt>uri( [$uri] )

The C<$r-E<gt>uri> method will return the requested URI minus optional
query string, optionally changing it with the first argument.

=head2 $r-E<gt>filename( [$filename] )

The C<$r-E<gt>filename> method will return the result of the I<URI --E<gt>
filename> translation, optionally changing it with the first argument
if you happen to be doing the translation.

=head2 $r-E<gt>location

The C<$r-E<gt>location> method will return the path of the
E<lt>LocationE<gt> section from which the current C<Perl*Handler> is
being called.

=head2 $r-E<gt>path_info( [$path_info] )

The C<$r-E<gt>path_info> method will return what is left in the path
after the I<URI --E<gt> filename> translation, optionally changing it with
the first argument if you happen to be doing the translation.

=head2 $r-E<gt>args( [$query_string] )

The C<$r-E<gt>args> method will return the contents of the URI I<query
string>.  When called in a scalar context, the entire string is
returned.  When called in a list context, a list of parsed I<key> =E<gt>
I<value> pairs are returned, i.e. it can be used like this:

   $query = $r->args;
   %in    = $r->args;

C<$r-E<gt>args> can also be used to set the I<query string>. This can be
useful when redirecting a POST request.

=head2 $r-E<gt>headers_in

The C<$r-E<gt>headers_in> method will return a C<%hash> of client request
headers.  This can be used to initialize a perl hash, or one could use
the C<$r-E<gt>header_in()> method (described below) to retrieve a specific
header value directly.

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the I<Apache::Table>
class when called in a scalar context with no "key" argument. This
requires I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>header_in( $header_name, [$value] )

Return the value of a client header.  Can be used like this:

   $ct = $r->header_in("Content-type");
   $r->header_in($key, $val); #set the value of header '$key'

=head2 $r-E<gt>content

The C<$r-E<gt>content> method will return the entity body read from the
client, but only if the request content type is
C<application/x-www-form-urlencoded>.
When called in a scalar context, the entire string is
returned.  When called in a list context, a list of parsed I<key> =E<gt>
I<value> pairs are returned.  B<NOTE>: you can only ask for this once,
as the entire body is read from the client.

=head2 $r-E<gt>read($buf, $bytes_to_read, [$offset])

This method is used to read data from the client, 
looping until it gets all of C<$bytes_to_read> or a timeout happens.

An offset may be specified to place the read data at some other place
than the beginning of the string.

In addition, this method sets a timeout before reading with
C<$r-E<gt>soft_timeout>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>get_remote_host

Lookup the client's DNS hostname. If the configuration directive
B<HostNameLookups> is set to off, this returns the dotted decimal
representation of the client's IP address instead. Might return
I<undef> if the hostname is not known.

=head2 $r-E<gt>get_remote_logname

Lookup the remote user's system name.  Might return I<undef> if the
remote system is not running an RFC 1413 server or if the configuration
directive B<IdentityCheck> is not turned on.

=head2 $r-E<gt>user( [$user] )

If an authentication check was successful, the authentication handler
caches the user name here. Sets the user name to the optional first
argument.


=head2 Apache::Connection

More information about the client can be obtained from the
B<Apache::Connection> object, as described below.

=head2 $c = $r-E<gt>connection

The C<$r-E<gt>connection> method will return a reference to the request
connection object (blessed into the B<Apache::Connection> package).
This is really a C<conn_rec*> in disguise.  The following methods can
be used on the connection object:

=head3 $c-E<gt>remote_host

If the configuration directive B<HostNameLookups> is set to on:  then
the first time C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_host> is called the server does a DNS
lookup to get the remote client's host name.  The result is cached in
C<$c-E<gt>remote_host> then returned. If the server was unable to resolve
the remote client's host name this will be set to "". Subsequent calls
to C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_host> return this cached value.

If the configuration directive B<HostNameLookups> is set to off: calls
to C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_host> return a string that contains the dotted
decimal representation of the remote client's IP address. However this
string is not cached, and C<$c-E<gt>remote_host> is undefined. So, it's
best to to call C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_host> instead of directly accessing
this variable.

=head3 $c-E<gt>remote_ip

The dotted decimal representation of the remote client's IP address.
This is set by the server when the connection record is created so
is always defined.

You can also set this value by providing an argument to it. This is
helpful if your server is behind a squid accelerator proxy which adds
a I<X-Forwarded-For> header.

=head3 $c-E<gt>local_addr

A packed C<SOCKADDR_IN> in the same format as returned by
C<Socket::pack_sockaddr_in>, containing the port and address on the
local host that the remote client is connected to.  This is set by
the server when the connection record is created so it is always
defined.

=head3 $c-E<gt>remote_addr

A packed C<SOCKADDR_IN> in the same format as returned by
C<Socket::pack_sockaddr_in>, containing the port and address on the
remote host that the server is connected to.  This is set by the
server when the connection record is created so it is always defined.

Among other things, this can be used, together with
C<$c-E<gt>local_addr>, to perform RFC1413 ident lookups on the remote
client even when the configuration directive B<IdentityCheck> is turned
off.

Can be used like:

   use Net::Ident qw (lookupFromInAddr);
   ...
   my $remoteuser = lookupFromInAddr ($c->local_addr,
                                      $c->remote_addr, 2);

Note that the lookupFromInAddr interface does not currently exist in
the B<Net::Ident> module, but the author is planning on adding it
soon.

=head3 $c-E<gt>remote_logname

If the configuration directive B<IdentityCheck> is set to on:  then the
first time C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_logname> is called the server does an RFC
1413 (ident) lookup to get the remote users system name. Generally for
UNI* systems this is their login. The result is cached in
C<$c-E<gt>remote_logname> then returned.  Subsequent calls to
C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_host> return the cached value.

If the configuration directive B<IdentityCheck> is set to off: then 
C<$r-E<gt>get_remote_logname> does nothing and C<$c-E<gt>remote_logname>
is always undefined.

=head3 $c-E<gt>user( [$user] )

Deprecated, use C<$r-E<gt>user> instead.

=head3 $c-E<gt>auth_type

Returns the authentication scheme that successfully authenticate
C<$c-E<gt>user>, if any.

=head3 $c-E<gt>aborted

Returns true if the client stopped talking to us.

=head3 $c-E<gt>fileno( [$direction] )

Returns the client file descriptor. If $direction is 0, the input fd
is returned. If $direction is not null or ommitted, the output fd is
returned.

This can be used to detect client disconnect without doing any I/O,
e.g. using C<IO::Select>.

=head1 Server Configuration Information

The following methods are used to obtain information from server
configuration and access control files.

=head2 $r-E<gt>dir_config( $key )

Returns the value of a per-directory variable specified by the 
C<PerlSetVar> directive.

   # <Location /foo/bar>
   # PerlSetVar  Key  Value
   # </Location>

   my $val = $r->dir_config('Key');

Keys are case-insensitive.

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the
I<Apache::Table> class when called in a scalar context with no
"key" argument. See I<Apache::Table>.


=head2 $r-E<gt>dir_config-E<gt>get( $key )

Returns the value of a per-directory array variable specified by the
C<PerlAddVar> directive.

   # <Location /foo/bar>
   # PerlAddVar  Key  Value1
   # PerlAddVar  Key  Value2
   # </Location>

   my @val = $r->dir_config->get('Key');

Alternatively in your code you can extend the setting with:

  $r->dir_config->add(Key => 'Value3');

Keys are case-insensitive.

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the
I<Apache::Table> class when called in a scalar context with no
"key" argument. See I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>requires

Returns an array reference of hash references, containing information
related to the B<require> directive.  This is normally used for access
control, see C<Apache::AuthzAge> for an example.

=head2 $r-E<gt>auth_type

Returns a reference to the current value of the per directory
configuration directive B<AuthType>. Normally this would be set to
C<Basic> to use the basic authentication scheme defined in RFC 1945,
I<Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0>. However, you could set to
something else and implement your own authentication scheme.

=head2 $r-E<gt>auth_name

Returns a reference to the current value of the per directory
configuration directive B<AuthName>.  The AuthName directive creates
protection realm within the server document space. To quote RFC 1945
"These realms allow the protected resources on a server to be
partitioned into a set of protection spaces, each with its own
authentication scheme and/or authorization database." The client uses
the root URL of the server to determine which authentication
credentials to send with each HTTP request. These credentials are
tagged with the name of the authentication realm that created them.
Then during the authentication stage the server uses the current
authentication realm, from C<$r-E<gt>auth_name>, to determine which set of
credentials to authenticate.

=head2 $r-E<gt>document_root ( [$docroot] )

When called with no argument, returns a reference to the current value
of the per server configuration directive B<DocumentRoot>. To quote the
Apache server documentation, "Unless matched by a directive like Alias,
the server appends the path from the requested URL to the document root
to make the path to the document."  This same value is passed to CGI
scripts in the C<DOCUMENT_ROOT> environment variable.

You can also set this value by providing an argument to it. The following
example dynamically sets the document root based on the request's
"Host:" header:

   sub trans_handler
     {
        my $r = shift;
        my ($user) = ($r->header_in('Host') =~ /^[^\.]+/);
        $r->document_root("/home/$user/www");
        return DECLINED;
     }
    
   PerlTransHandler trans_handler

=head2 $r-E<gt>server_root_relative( [$relative_path] )

If called without any arguments, this method returns the value of the
currently-configured C<ServerRoot> directory.

If a single argument is passed, it concatenates it with the value of
C<ServerRoot>. For example here is how to get the path to the
I<error_log> file under the server root:

 my $error_log = $r->server_root_relative("logs/error_log");

See also the next item.

=head2 Apache-E<gt>server_root_relative( [$relative_path] )

Same as the previous item, but this time it's used without a request
object. This method is usually needed in a startup file. For example
the following startup file modifies C<@INC> to add a local directory
with perl modules located under the server root and after that loads a
module from that directory.

  BEGIN {
      use Apache():
      use lib Apache->server_root_relative("lib/my_project");
  }
  use MyProject::Config ();


=head2 $r-E<gt>allow_options

The C<$r-E<gt>allow_options> method can be used for
checking if it is OK to run a perl script.  The B<Apache::Options>
module provides the constants to check against.

   if(!($r->allow_options & OPT_EXECCGI)) {
       $r->log_reason("Options ExecCGI is off in this directory", 
		      $filename);
   }

=head2 $r-E<gt>get_server_port

Returns the port number on which the server is listening.

=head2 $s = $r-E<gt>server

Return a reference to the server info object (blessed into the
B<Apache::Server> package).  This is really a C<server_rec*> in
disguise.  The following methods can be used on the server object:

=head2 $s = Apache-E<gt>server

Same as above, but only available during server startup for use in
C<E<lt>PerlE<gt>> sections, B<PerlRequire> or B<PerlModule>.

=head2 $s-E<gt>server_admin

Returns the mail address of the person responsible for this server.

=head2 $s-E<gt>server_hostname

Returns the hostname used by this server.

=head2 $s-E<gt>port

Returns the port that this servers listens too.

=head2 $s-E<gt>is_virtual

Returns true if this is a virtual server.

=head2 $s-E<gt>names

Returns the wild-carded names for ServerAlias servers. 

=head2 $s-E<gt>dir_config( $key )

Alias for C<Apache::dir_config>.

=head2 $s-E<gt>warn

Alias for C<Apache::warn>.

=head2 $s-E<gt>log_error

Alias for C<Apache::log_error>.

=head2 $s-E<gt>uid

Returns the numeric user id under which the server answers requests.
This is the value of the User directive.

=head2 $s-E<gt>gid

Returns the numeric group id under which the server answers requests.
This is the value of the Group directive.

=head2 $s-E<gt>loglevel

Get or set the value of the current LogLevel. This method is added by
the C<Apache::Log> module, which needs to be pulled in.

    use Apache::Log;
    print "LogLevel = ", $s->loglevel;
    $s->loglevel(Apache::Log::DEBUG);

If using Perl 5.005+, the following constants are defined (but not
exported):

    Apache::Log::EMERG
    Apache::Log::ALERT
    Apache::Log::CRIT
    Apache::Log::ERR
    Apache::Log::WARNING
    Apache::Log::NOTICE
    Apache::Log::INFO
    Apache::Log::DEBUG

=head2 $r-E<gt>get_handlers( $hook )

Returns a reference to a list of handlers enabled for $hook. $hook is
a string representing the phase to handle. The returned list is a list
of references to the handler subroutines.

	$list = $r->get_handlers( 'PerlHandler' );

=head2 $r-E<gt>set_handlers( $hook, [\E<amp>handler, ... ] )

Sets the list of handlers to be called for $hook. $hook is a string
representing the phase to handle. The list of handlers is an anonymous
array of code references to the handlers to install for this request
phase. The special list C<[ \&OK ]> can be used to disable a
particular phase.

	$r->set_handlers( PerlLogHandler => [ \&myhandler1, \&myhandler2 ] );
	$r->set_handlers( PerlAuthenHandler => [ \&OK ] );

=head2 $r-E<gt>push_handlers( $hook, \E<amp>handler  )

Pushes a new handler to be called for C<$hook>. C<$hook> is a string
representing the phase to handle. The handler is a reference to a
subroutine to install for this request phase. This handler will be
called before any configured handlers.

	$r->push_handlers( PerlHandler => \&footer);

=head2 $r-E<gt>current_callback

Returns the name of the handler currently being run. This method is most
useful to PerlDispatchHandlers who wish to only take action for certain
phases. 

	if($r->current_callback eq "PerlLogHandler") {
		$r->warn("Logging request");
	}


=head1 Setting Up the Response

The following methods are used to set up and return the response back
to the client.  This typically involves setting up C<$r-E<gt>status()>,
the various content attributes and optionally some additional
C<$r-E<gt>header_out()> calls before calling
C<$r-E<gt>send_http_header()> which will actually send the headers to the
client.  After this a typical application will call the
C<$r-E<gt>print()> method to send the response content to the client.

=head2 $r-E<gt>send_http_header( [$content_type] )

Send the response line and all headers to the client.
Takes an optional parameter indicating the content-type of the
response, i.e. 'C<text/html>'.

This method will create headers from the C<$r-E<gt>content_xxx()> and
C<$r-E<gt>no_cache()> attributes (described below) and then append the
headers defined by $r-E<gt>header_out (or C<$r-E<gt>err_header_out> if
status indicates an error).

=head2 $r-E<gt>get_basic_auth_pw

If the current request is protected by Basic authentication, this method
will return OK.  Otherwise, it will return a value that ought to be
propagated back to the client (typically C<AUTH_REQUIRED>). The second
return value will be the decoded password sent by the client.

   ($ret, $sent_pw) = $r->get_basic_auth_pw;

=head2 $r-E<gt>note_basic_auth_failure

Prior to requiring Basic authentication from the client, this method 
will set the outgoing HTTP headers asking the client to authenticate 
for the realm defined by the configuration directive C<AuthName>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>handler( [$meth] )

Set the handler for a request.
Normally set by the configuration directive C<AddHandler>.

   $r->handler( "perl-script" );

=head2 $r-E<gt>notes( $key, [$value] )

Return the value of a named entry in the Apache C<notes> table, or
optionally set the value of a named entry.  This table is used by Apache
modules to pass messages amongst themselves. Generally if you are
writing handlers in mod_perl you can use Perl variables for this.

   $r->notes("MY_HANDLER" => OK);
   $val = $r->notes("MY_HANDLER");

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the I<Apache::Table>
class when called in a scalar context with no "key" argument. This
requires I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>pnotes( $key, [$value] )

Like C<$r-E<gt>notes>, but takes any scalar as an value.

   $r->pnotes("MY_HANDLER" => [qw(one two)]);
   my $val = $r->pnotes("MY_HANDLER");
   print $val->[0];     # prints "one"

Advantage over just using a Perl variable is that C<$r-E<gt>pnotes> gets
cleaned up after every request.

=head2 $r-E<gt>subprocess_env( $key, [$value] )

Return the value of a named entry in the Apache C<subprocess_env>
table, or optionally set the value of a named entry. This table is
used by mod_include.  By setting some custom variables inside
a perl handler it is possible to combine perl with mod_include nicely.
If you say, e.g. in a PerlHeaderParserHandler

   $r->subprocess_env(MyLanguage => "de");

you can then write in your .shtml document:

   <!--#if expr="$MyLanguage = en" -->
   English
   <!--#elif expr="$MyLanguage = de" -->
   Deutsch
   <!--#else -->
   Sorry
   <!--#endif -->

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the I<Apache::Table>
class when called in a scalar context with no "key" argument. This
requires I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>content_type( [$newval] )

Get or set the content type being sent to the client.  Content types
are strings like C<"text/plain">, C<"text/html"> or C<"image/gif">.  This
corresponds to the C<"Content-Type"> header in the HTTP protocol.  Example
of usage is:

   $previous_type = $r->content_type;
   $r->content_type("text/plain");

=head2 $r-E<gt>content_encoding( [$newval] )

Get or set the content encoding.  Content encodings are string like
"gzip" or "compress".  This correspond to the "Content-Encoding"
header in the HTTP protocol.

=head2 $r-E<gt>content_languages( [$array_ref] )

Get or set the content languages.  The content language corresponds to the
"Content-Language" HTTP header and is an array reference containing
strings such as "en" or "no".

=head2 $r-E<gt>status( $integer )

Get or set the reply status for the client request.  The
B<Apache::Constants> module provide mnemonic names for the status codes.

=head2 $r-E<gt>status_line( $string )

Get or set the response status line.  The status line is a string like
"200 Document follows" and it will take precedence over the value
specified using the C<$r-E<gt>status()> described above.


=head2 $r-E<gt>headers_out

The C<$r-E<gt>headers_out> method will return a C<%hash> of server
response headers.  This can be used to initialize a perl hash, or one
could use the C<$r-E<gt>header_out()> method (described below) to
retrieve or set a specific header value directly.

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the I<Apache::Table>
class when called in a scalar context with no "key" argument. This
requires I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>header_out( $header, $value )

Change the value of a response header, or create a new one.  You
should not define any "Content-XXX" headers by calling this method,
because these headers use their own specific methods.  Example of use:

   $r->header_out("WWW-Authenticate" => "Basic");
   $val = $r->header_out($key);

=head2 $r-E<gt>err_headers_out

The C<$r-E<gt>err_headers_out> method will return a %hash of server
response headers.  This can be used to initialize a perl hash, or one
could use the C<$r-E<gt>err_header_out()> method (described below) to
retrieve or set a specific header value directly.

The difference between headers_out and err_headers_out is that the
latter are printed even on error, and persist across internal redirects
(so the headers printed for ErrorDocument handlers will have them).

Will return a I<HASH> reference blessed into the I<Apache::Table>
class when called in a scalar context with no "key" argument. This
requires I<Apache::Table>.

=head2 $r-E<gt>err_header_out( $header, [$value] )

Change the value of an error response header, or create a new one.
These headers are used if the status indicates an error.

   $r->err_header_out("Warning" => "Bad luck");
   $val = $r->err_header_out($key);

=head2 $r-E<gt>no_cache( $boolean )

This is a flag that indicates that the data being returned is volatile
and the client should be told not to cache it. C<$r-E<gt>no_cache(1)>
adds the headers C<"Pragma: no-cache"> and C<"Cache-control: no-cache"> to
the reponse, therefore it must be called before
C<$r-E<gt>send_http_header>. 

=head2 $r-E<gt>print( @list )

This method sends data to the client with C<$r-E<gt>write_client>, but
first sets a timeout before sending with C<$r-E<gt>soft_timeout>. This
method is called instead of C<CORE::print> when you use C<print()> in
your mod_perl programs. 

This method treats scalar references specially. If an item in C<@list> is
a scalar reference, it will be dereferenced before printing. This is a
performance optimization which prevents unneeded copying of large strings,
and it is subtly different from Perl's standard C<print()> behavior.

Example:

   $foo = \"bar"; print($foo);

The result is "bar", not the "SCALAR(0xDEADBEEF)" you might have
expected. If you really want the reference to be printed out, force it
into a scalar context by using C<print(scalar($foo))>.

The print-a-scalar-reference feature is now deprecated. There are
known bugs when using it and it's not supported by mod_perl 2.0. If
you have a scalar reference containing a string to be printed,
dereference it before sending it to print.

=head2 $r-E<gt>send_fd( $filehandle )

Send the contents of a file to the client.  Can for instance be used
like this:

  open(FILE, $r->filename) || return 404;
  $r->send_fd(FILE);
  close(FILE);

=head2 $r-E<gt>internal_redirect( $newplace )

Redirect to a location in the server namespace without 
telling the client. For instance:

   $r->internal_redirect("/home/sweet/home.html");

=head2 $r-E<gt>internal_redirect_handler( $newplace )

Same as I<internal_redirect>, but the I<handler> from C<$r> is preserved.

=head2 $r-E<gt>custom_response($code, $uri)

This method provides a hook into the B<ErrorDocument> mechanism,
allowing you to configure a custom response for a given response
code at request-time.

Example:

    use Apache::Constants ':common';

    sub handler {
        my ($r) = @_;

        if($things_are_ok) {
	    return OK;
        }

        #<Location $r->uri>
        #ErrorDocument 401 /error.html
        #</Location>

        $r->custom_response(AUTH_REQUIRED, "/error.html");

        #can send a string too
        #<Location $r->uri>
        #ErrorDocument 401 "sorry, go away"
        #</Location>

        #$r->custom_response(AUTH_REQUIRED, "sorry, go away");

        return AUTH_REQUIRED;
    }


=head1 Server Core Functions

=head2 $r-E<gt>soft_timeout($message)

=head2 $r-E<gt>hard_timeout($message)

=head2 $r-E<gt>kill_timeout

=head2 $r-E<gt>reset_timeout

(Documentation borrowed from http_main.h)

There are two functions which modules can call to trigger a timeout
(with the per-virtual-server timeout duration); these are C<hard_timeout>
and C<soft_timeout>.

The difference between the two is what happens when the timeout
expires (or earlier than that, if the client connection aborts) ---
a C<soft_timeout> just puts the connection to the client in an
"aborted" state, which will cause I<http_protocol.c> to stop trying to
talk to the client, but otherwise allows the code to continue normally.
C<hard_timeout()>, by contrast, logs the request, and then aborts it
completely --- C<longjmp()>ing out to the C<accept()> loop in
C<http_main>. Any resources tied into the request resource pool will be
cleaned up; everything that is not will leak.

C<soft_timeout()> is recommended as a general rule, because it gives your
code a chance to clean up.  However, C<hard_timeout()> may be the most
convenient way of dealing with timeouts waiting for some external
resource other than the client, if you can live with the restrictions.

When a hard timeout is in scope, critical sections can be guarded
with C<block_alarms()> and C<unblock_alarms()> --- these are declared in
I<alloc.c> because they are most often used in conjunction with
routines to allocate something or other, to make sure that the
cleanup does get registered before any alarm is allowed to happen
which might require it to be cleaned up; they * are, however,
implemented in I<http_main.c>.

C<kill_timeout()> will disarm either variety of timeout.

C<reset_timeout()> resets the timeout in progress.

=head2 $r-E<gt>post_connection($code_ref)

=head2 $r-E<gt>register_cleanup($code_ref)

Register a cleanup function which is called just before $r-E<gt>pool is
destroyed.

   $r->register_cleanup(sub {
       my $r = shift;
       warn "registered cleanup called for ", $r->uri, "\n";
   });

Cleanup functions registered in the parent process (before forking)
will run once when the server is shut down:

   #PerlRequire startup.pl
   warn "parent pid is $$\n";
   Apache->server->register_cleanup(sub { warn "server cleanup in $$\n"});

The I<post_connection> method is simply an alias for I<register_cleanup>, 
as this method may be used to run code after the client connection is
closed, which may not be a I<cleanup>.

=head1 CGI Support

We also provide some methods that make it easier to support the CGI
type of interface.

=head2 $r-E<gt>send_cgi_header()

Take action on certain headers including I<Status:>, I<Location:> and
I<Content-type:> just as mod_cgi does, then calls
$r-E<gt>send_http_header().  Example of use:

   $r->send_cgi_header(<<EOT);
   Location: /foo/bar
   Content-type: text/html

   EOT


=head1 Error Logging

The following methods can be used to log errors. 


=head2 $r-E<gt>log_reason($message, $file)

The request failed, why??  Write a message to the server errorlog.

   $r->log_reason("Because I felt like it", $r->filename);

=head2 $r-E<gt>log_error($message)

Uh, oh.  Write a message to the server errorlog.

   $r->log_error("Some text that goes in the error_log");

=head2 $r-E<gt>warn($message)

For pre-1.3 versions of apache, this is just an alias for
C<log_error>.  With 1.3+ versions of apache, this message will only be
send to the error_log if B<LogLevel> is set to B<warn> or higher. 


=head1 Utility Functions


=head2 Apache::unescape_url($string)

  $unescaped_url = Apache::unescape_url($string)

Handy function for unescapes.  Use this one for
filenames/paths. Notice that the original C<$string> is mangled in the
process (because the string part of PV shrinks, but the variable is
not updated, to speed things up).

Use C<unescape_url_info> for the result of submitted form data.

=head2 Apache::unescape_url_info($string)

Handy function for unescapes submitted form data.
In opposite to C<unescape_url> it translates the plus sign to space.

=head2 Apache::perl_hook($hook)

Returns true if the specified callback hook is enabled:

   for (qw(Access Authen Authz ChildInit Cleanup Fixup
           HeaderParser Init Log Trans Type))
   {
       print "$_ hook enabled\n" if Apache::perl_hook($_);
   }  


=head1 Global Variables


=head2 $Apache::Server::Starting

Set to true when the server is starting.

=head2 $Apache::Server::ReStarting

Set to true when the server is starting.
