Per Einar Ellefsen:

* Added C<Apache::*> modules from core to complete the API. Reviewed
  the content, added right tags and indentation where needed.

* Apache::File: added synopsis.

* Added various other modules that were left-over. Some don't have
  much documentation, but that doesn't matter, the synopsis is usually
  enough.

* Fixed all module names in "See Also" sections to link to the correct
  place if possible.

* Reorganized everything into groups.
