Discussion of multithreading on Win32 mod_perl 1.xx

=head1 Description

This document discusses the multithreading limitations of
mod_perl-1.xx on Win32.

=head1 The problem

On Win32, mod_perl is effectively single threaded. What this
means is that a single instance of the interpreter is created,
and this is then protected by a server-wide lock that prevents
more than one thread from using the interpreter at any one time.
The fact that this will prevent parallel processing of requests,
including static requests, can have serious implications for
production servers that often must handle concurrent or
long-running requests.

This situation changes with Apache/mod_perl 2.0, which is based on a
multi-process/multi-thread approach using a native Win32 threads
implementation. See the L<mod_perl 2
overview|docs::2.0::user::intro::overview> for more details,
and the discussion of L<modperl-2 in Win32|docs::2.0::os::win32::install>
on getting modperl-2 for Win32 in particular.

=head1 Does it really matter?

How serious is this? For some people and application classes it may be a 
non-problem, assuming the static material issue is handled differently.

Low traffic and single user development sites will likely be
unaffected (though the lattest are likely to experience some surprises
when moving to an environment where requests are no longer serialized
and concurrency kicks in).

If your application is CPU bound, and all requests take roughly the
same time to complete, then having more processing threads than
processors (CPUs) will actually slow things down, because of the
context switching overhead. Note that, even in this case, the current
state of mod_perl will bar owners of multiprocessor Win32 machines
from gaining any load balancing advantage from their superior hardware.

On the other hand, applications dealing with a large service times
spread - say ranging from fractions of a second to a minute and above
- stand to lose a great deal of responsiveness from being single
threaded. The reason is that short requests that happen to be queueued
after long ones will be delayed for the entire duration of the "jobs"
that precede them in the queue; with multitasking they would get a chance 
to complete much earlier.

=head1 Workarounds

If you need multithreading on Win32, either because your application
has long running requests, or because you can afford multiprocessor
hardware, and assuming you cannot switch operating systems, you may
want to consider a few workarounds and/or alternatives - which do not
require waiting for 2.0.

You may be able to make Win32 multithreading a non-issue by tuning or
rearranging your application and your architecture (useful tips on
both counts can be found elsewhere in this document). You may be able
to significantly reduce your worst-case timing problems or you may
find that you can move the webserver to a more mod_perl friendly
operating system by using a multi-tier scheme.

If your application needs the full power of the Apache modules (often
the case for people running outside Apache::Registry) you may want to
consider a multi-server load balancing setup which uses mod_rewrite
(or a similar URL partitioning scheme) to spread requests to several web
servers, listening on different ports. 

The mod_proxy dual server setup, discussed in the "Strategy" section,
is also a possibility, although people who have tried it have reported
problems with Win32 mod_proxy.

If you code to Apache::Registry (writing CGI compliant code) and can
characterize the time demanded by a request from its URL, you can use
a rewrite-based load balancing with a single server, by sending short
requests to mod_perl while routing longer ones to the pure CGI
environment - on the basis that startup, compilation and init times
will matter less in this case.

If none of the above works for you, then you will have to turn to some
non mod_perl alternatives: this, however, implies giving up on most of
the flexibility of the Apache modules.

For CGI compliant scripts, two possible (portable) alternatives which
are supported in an Apache/perl environment are straight CGI and
FastCGI. In theory a CGI application that runs under mod_perl should
have very few or no problems to run under straight CGI (though its
performance may be unacceptable). A FastCGI port should also be
relatively painless. However, as always, your mileage may vary.

If you do not mind replacing Apache with IIS/PWS, you may want
to experiment with ActiveState's value added PerlEx extension, which
speeds up CGI scripts much in a way similar to what FastCGI
does. PerlEx is transparently supported by CGI.pm, so users of this
package should be more or less covered. (A IIS-FastCGI accelerator is,
regrettably, no longer available.)
