=head1 NAME

Building a Large-Scale E-commerce site with Apache and mod_perl

=head1 Description

mod_perl's speed and Perl's flexibility make them very attractive for
large-scale sites. Through careful planning from the start, powerful
application servers can be created for sites requiring excellent
response times for dynamic content, such as EToys, all by using
mod_perl.

This paper was first presented at ApacheCon 2001 in Santa Clara,
California, and was later published by O'Reilly & Associates' Perl.com
site: http://perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/17/etoys.html

=head1 Common Myths

When it comes to building a large e-commerce web site, everyone is
full of advice. Developers will tell you that only a site built in C++
or Java (depending on which they prefer) can scale up to handle heavy
traffic. Application server vendors will insist that you need a
packaged all-in-one solution for the software. Hardware vendors will
tell you that you need the top-of-the-line mega-machines to run a
large site. This is a story about how we built a large e-commerce site
using mainly open source software and commodity hardware. We did it,
and you can do it too.

=head1 Perl Saves

Perl has long been the preferred language for developing CGI scripts.
It combines supreme flexibility with rapid development. I<Programming
Perl> is still one of O'Reilly's top selling technical books, and
community support abounds. Lately though, Perl has come under attack
from certain quarters. Detractors claim that it's too slow for serious
development work and that code written in Perl is too hard to
maintain.

The mod_perl Apache module changes the whole performance picture for
Perl. Embedding a Perl interpreter inside of Apache provides
performance equivalent to Java servlets, and makes it an excellent
choice for building large sites. Through the use of Perl's
object-oriented features and some basic coding rules, you can build a
set of code that is a pleasure to maintain, or at least no worse than
other languages.

=head2 Roll Your Own Application Server

When you combine Apache, mod_perl, and open source code available from
CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), you get a set of
features equivalent to a commercial application server:

=over

=item *

Session handling

=item *

Load balancing

=item *

Persistent database connections

=item *

Advanced HTML templating

=item *

Security

=back

You also get some things you won't get from a commercial product, like
a direct line to the core development team through the appropriate
mailing list, and the ability to fix problems yourself instead of
waiting for a patch. Moreover, every part of the system is under your
control, making you limited only by your team's abilities.

=head1 Case Study: eToys.com

When we first arrived at eToys in 1999, we found a situation that is
probably familiar to many who have joined a growing startup Internet
company. The system was based on CGI scripts talking to a MySQL
database. Static file serving and dynamic content generation were
sharing resources on the same machines. The CGI code was largely
written in a Perl4-ish style and not as modular as it could be, which
was not surprising since most of it was built as quickly as possible
by a very small team.

Our major task was to figure out how to get this system to scale large
enough to handle the expected Christmas traffic. The toy business is
all about seasonality, and the difference between the peak selling
season and the rest of the year is enormous. The site had barely
survived the previous Christmas, and the MySQL database didn't look
like it could scale much further.

The call had already been made to switch to Oracle, and a DBA team was
in place. We didn't have enough time to do a re-design of the
software, so we had to scramble to put in place whatever performance
improvements we could finish by Christmas.

=head2 Apache::PerlRun to the Rescue

C<Apache::PerlRun> is a module that exists to smooth the transition
between basic CGI and mod_perl. It emulates a CGI environment, and
provides some (but not all) of the performance benefits associated
with code written for mod_perl. Using this module and the persistent
database connections provided by C<Apache::DBI>, we were able to do a
basic port to mod_perl and Oracle in time for Christmas, and combined
with some new hardware we were ready to face the Christmas rush.

The peak traffic lasted for eight weeks, most of which were spent
frantically fixing things or nervously waiting for something else to
break. Nevertheless, we made it through. During that time we collected
the following statistics:

=over

=item *

60 - 70,000 sessions/hour

=item *

800,000 page views/hour

=item *

7,000 orders/hour

=back

According to Media Metrix, we were the third most heavily trafficked
e-commerce site, right behind eBay and Amazon.

=head2 Planning the New Architecture

It was clear that we would need to do a re-design for 2000. We had
reached the limits of the current system and needed to tackle some of
the harder problems that we had been holding off on.

Goals for the new system included moving away from off-line page
generation. The old system had been building HTML pages for every
product and product category on the site in a batch job and dumping
them out as static files. This was very effective when we had a small
database of products since the static files gave such good
performance, but we had recently added a children's bookstore to the
site, which increased the size of our product database by an order of
magnitude and made the time required to generate every page
prohibitive. We needed a strategy that would only require us to build
pages that customers were actually interested in and would still
provide solid performance.

We also wanted to re-do the database schema for more flexibility, and
structure the code in a more modular way that would make it easier for
a team to share the development work without stepping on each other. We
knew that the new codebase would have to be flexible enough to support
a continuously evolving set of features.

Not all of the team had significant experience with object-oriented
Perl, so we brought in Randal Schwartz and Damian Conway to do
training sessions with us. We created a set of coding standards,
drafted a design, and built our system.

=head1 Surviving Christmas 2000

Our capacity planning was for three times the traffic of the previous
peak. That's what we tested to, and that's about what we got:

=over

=item *

200,000+ sessions/hour

=item *

2.5 million+ page views/hour

=item *

20,000+ orders/hour

=back

The software survived, although one of the routers went up in smoke.
Once again, we were rated the third most highly trafficked e-commerce
site for the season.

=head2 The Architecture

The machine strategy for the system is a fairly common one: low-cost
Intel-based servers with a load-balancer in front of them, and big
iron for the database.

<img src="machine_layout.png" alt="Machine Layout" width="344"
height="472">

Like many commercial packages, we have separate systems for the
front-end web servers (which we call proxy servers) and the
application servers that generate the dynamic content. Both the proxy
servers and the application servers are load-balanced using dedicated
hardware from f5 Networks.

We chose to run Linux on our proxy and application servers, a common
platform for mod_perl sites. The ease of remote administration under
Linux made the clustered approach possible. Linux also provided solid
security features and automated build capabilities to help with adding
new servers.

The database servers were IBM NUMA-Q machines, which ran on the
DYNIX/ptx operating system..

=head2 Proxy Servers

The proxy servers ran a slim build of Apache, without mod_perl. They
have several standard Apache modules installed, in addition to our own
customized version of mod_session, which assigned session cookies.
Because the processes were so small, we could run up to 400 Apache
children per machine. These servers handled all image requests
themselves, and passed page requests on to the application
servers. They communicated with the app servers using standard HTTP
requests, and cached the page results when appropriate headers are
sent from the app servers. The cached pages were stored on a shared
NFS partition of a Network Appliance filer. Serving pages from the
cache was nearly as fast as serving static files.

This kind of reverse-proxy setup is a commonly recommended approach
when working with mod_perl, since it uses the lightweight proxy
processes to send out the content to clients (who may be on slow
connections) and frees the resource-intensive mod_perl processes to
move on to the next request. For more information on why this
configuration is helpful, see the L<strategy section in the users
guide|guide::strategy>.

height="211">

=head2 Application Servers

The application servers ran mod_perl, and very little else.  They had
a local cache for Perl objects, using Berkeley DB.  The web
applications ran there, and shared resources like HTML templates were
mounted over NFS from the NetApp filer.  Because they did the heavy
lifting in this setup, these machines were somewhat beefy, with dual
CPUs and 1GB of RAM each.

<img src="app_servers.png" alt="Application servers layout"
width="444" height="387">

=head2 Search servers

There was a third set of machines dedicated to handling searches.
Since searching was such a large percentage of overall traffic, it was
worthwhile to dedicate resources to it and take the load off the
application servers and database.

The software on these boxes was a multi-threaded daemon which we
developed in-house using C++.  The application servers talked to the
search servers using a Perl module.  The search daemon accepted a set
of search conditions and returned a sorted list of object IDs of the
products whose data fits those conditions.  Then the application
servers looked up the data to display these products from the
database.  The search servers knew nothing about HTML or the web
interface.

This approach of finding the IDs with the search server and then
retrieving the object data may sound like a performance hit, but in
practice the object data usually came from the application server's
cache rather than the database.  This design allowed us to minimize
the duplicated data between the database and the search servers,
making it easier and faster to refresh the index.  It also let us
reuse the same Perl code for retrieving product objects from the
database, regardless of how they were found.

The daemon used a standard inverted word list approach to searching.
The index was periodically built from the relevant data in
Oracle. There are modules on CPAN which implement this approach,
including C<Search::InvertedIndex> and C<DBIx::FullTextSearch>. We
chose to write our own because of the very tight performance
requirements on this part of the system, and because we had an
unusually complex set of sorting rules for the returned IDs.

=head1 Load Balancing and Failover

We took pains to make sure that we would be able to provide load
balancing among nodes of the cluster and fault tolerance in case one
or more nodes failed.  The proxy servers were balanced using a random
selection algorithm.  A user could end up on a different one on every
request.  These servers didn't hold any state information, so the goal
was just to distribute the load evenly.

The application servers used ``sticky'' load balancing. That means
that once a user went to a particular app server, all of her
subsequent requests during that session were also passed to the same
app server. The f5 hardware accomplished this using browser cookies.
Using sticky load balancing on the app servers allowed us to do some
local caching of user data.

The load balancers ran a periodic service check on every server and
removed any servers that failed the check from rotation. When a server
failed, all users that were ``stuck''; to that machine were moved to
another one.

In order to ensure that no data was lost if an app server died, all
updates were written to the database.  As a result, user data like the
contents of a shopping cart was preserved even in cases of
catastrophic hardware failure on an app server.  This is essential for
a large e-commerce site.

The database had a separate failover system, which we will not go into
here. It followed standard practices recommended by our vendors.

=head1 Code Structure

The code was structured around the classic Model-View-Controller
pattern, originally from SmallTalk and now often applied to web
applications.  The MVC pattern is a way of splitting an application's
responsibilities into three distinct layers.

Classes in the Model layer represented business concepts and data,
like products or users.  These had an API but no end-user interface.
They knew nothing about HTTP or HTML and could be used in non-web
applications, like cron jobs.  They talked to the database and other
data sources, and managed their own persistence.

The Controller layer translated web requests into appropriate actions
on the Model layer.  It handled parsing parameters, checking input,
fetching the appropriate Model objects, and calling methods on them.
Then it determined the appropriate View to use and sendt the resulting
HTML to the user.

View objects were really HTML templates.  The Controller passed data
from the Model objects to them and they generated a web page.  These
were implemented with the Template Toolkit, a powerful templating
system written in Perl.  The templates had some basic conditional
statements and looping in them, but only enough to express the
formatting logic.  No application control flow was embedded in the
templates.

<p><b>Figure 5. </b> <a href="code_structure.png">Code
structure and interaction between the layers</a></p>

=head1 Caching

The core of the performance strategy is a multi-tier caching
system. On the application servers, data objects are cached in shared
memory with a backing store on local disk. Applications specify how
long a data object can be out of sync with the database, and all
future accesses during that time are served from the high-speed
cache. This type of cache control is known as "time-to-live." The
local cache is implemented using a I<Berkeley DB> database. Objects
are serialized with the standard C<Storable> module from CPAN.

Data objects are divided into pieces when necessary to provide finer
granularity for expiration times. For example, product inventory is
updated more frequently than other product data. By splitting the
product data up, we can use a short expiration for inventory that
keeps it in tighter sync with the database, while still using a longer
expiration for the less volatile parts of the product data.

The application servers' object caches share product data between them
using the IP Multicast protocol and custom daemons written in C. When
a product is placed in the cache on one server, the data is replicated
to the cache on all other servers. This technique is very successful
because of the high locality of access in product data. During the
2000 Christmas season this cache achieved a 99% hit ratio, thus taking
a large amount of work off the database.

In addition to caching the data objects, entire pages that are not
user-specific, like product detail pages, can be cached. The
application takes the shortest expiration time of the data objects
used in the pages and specifies that to the proxy servers as a page
expiration time, using standard I<Expires> headers. The proxy servers
cache the generated page on a shared NFS partition. Pages served from
this cache have performance close to that of static pages.

To allow for emergency fixes, we added a hook to C<mod_proxy> that
deletes the cached copy of a specified URL. This was used when a page
needed to be changed immediately to fix incorrect information.

An extra advantage of this C<mod_proxy> cache is the automatic
handling of I<If-Modified-Since> requests. We did not need to
implement this ourselves since C<mod_proxy> already provides it.

=for html
<p><b>Figure 6. </b> <a href="proxy_architecture.png">Proxy and Cache
Interaction</a></p>

=head1 Session Tracking

Users are assigned session IDs using HTTP cookies. This is done at the
proxy servers by our customized version of C<mod_session>. Doing it at
the proxy ensures that users accessing cached pages will still get a
session ID assigned. The session ID is simply a key into data stored
on the server-side. User sessions are assigned to an application
server and continue to use that server unless it becomes
unavailable. This is called ``sticky&rdquo; load balancing. Session
data and other data modified by the user -- such as shopping cart
contents -- is written to both the object cache and the database. The
double write carries a slight performance penalty, but it allows for
fast read access on subsequent requests without going back to the
database. If a server failure causes a user to be moved to a different
application server, the data is simply fetched from the database
again.

=head1 Security

A large e-commerce site is a popular target for all types of attacks.
When designing such a system, you have to assume that you will be
attacked and build with security in mind, at the application level as
well as the machine level.

The main rule of thumb is ``don't trust the client!''  User-specific
data sent to the client is protected using multiple levels of
encryption. SSL keeps sensitive data exchanges private from anyone
snooping on network traffic. To prevent ``session hijacking'' (when
someone tampers with their session ID in order to gain access to
another user's session), we include a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) as part of the session cookie. This is generated using the
standard C<Digest::SHA1> module from CPAN, with a seed phrase known
only to our servers. By running the ID from the session cookie through
this MAC algorithm we can verify that the data being presented was
generated by us and not tampered with.

In situations where we need to include some state information in an
HTML form or URL and don't want it to be obvious to the user, we use
the CPAN C<Crypt::> modules to encrypt and decrypt it. The
C<Crypt::CBC> module is a good place to start.

To protect against simple overload attacks, when someone uses a
program to send high volumes of requests at our servers hoping to make
them unavailable to customers, access to the application servers is
controlled by a throttling program. The code is based on some work by
Randal Schwartz in his C<Stonehenge::Throttle> module. Accesses for
each user are tracked in compact logs written to an NFS partition. The
program enforces limits on how many requests a user can make within a
certain period of time.

For more information on web security concerns including the use of
MAC, encryption, and overload prevention, we recommend looking at the
books I<CGI Programming with Perl, 2nd Edition> and I<Writing Apache
Modules with Perl and C>, both from O'Reilly.

=head1 Exception Handling

When planning this system, we considered using Java as the
implementation language. We decided to go with Perl, but we really
missed Java's nice exception handling features. Luckily, Graham Barr's
Error module from CPAN supplies similar capabilities in Perl.

Perl already has support for trapping runtime errors and passing
exception objects, but the Error module adds some nice syntactic
sugar.  The following code sample is typical of how we used the
module:

    try {
    	do_some_stuff();
    } catch My::Exception with {
    	my $E = shift;
    	handle_exception($E);
    };

The module allows you to create your own exception classes and trap
for specific types of exceptions.

One nice benefit of this is the way it works with C<DBI>. If you turn
on C<DBI>'s I<RaiseError> flag and use try blocks in places where you
want to trap exceptions, the C<Error> module can turn C<DBI> errors
into simple C<Error> objects.

    try {
        $sth->execute();
    } catch Error with {
        # roll back and recover
        $dbh->rollback();
        # etc.
    };

This code shows a condition where an error would indicate that we
should roll back a database transaction. In practice, most C<DBI>
errors indicate something unexpected happened with the database and
the current action can't continue. Those exceptions are allowed to
propagate up to a top-level C<try{}> block that encloses the whole
request. When errors are caught there, we log a stacktrace and send a
friendly error page back to the user.

=head1 Templates

Both the HTML and the formatting logic for merging application data
into it is stored in the templates. They use a CPAN module called
I<Template Toolkit>, which provides a simple but powerful syntax for
accessing the Perl data structures passed to them by the application.
In addition to basics like looping and conditional statements, it
provides extensive support for modularization, allowing the use of
includes and macros to simplify template maintenance and avoid
redundancy.

We found I<Template Toolkit> to be an invaluable tool on this project.
Our HTML coders picked it up very quickly and were able to do nearly
all of the templating work without help from the Perl coders. We
supplied them with documentation of what data would be passed to each
template and they did the rest. If you have never experienced the joy
of telling a project manager that the HTML team can handle his
requested changes without any help from you, you are seriously missing
out!

I<Template Toolkit> compiles templates into Perl bytecode and caches
them in memory to improve efficiency. When template files change on
disk they are picked up and re-compiled. This is similar to how other
C<mod_perl> systems like Mason and C<Apache::Registry> work.

By varying the template search path, we made it possible to assign
templates to particular sections of the site, allowing a customized
look and feel for specific areas. For example, the page header
template in the bookstore section of the site can be different from
the one in the video game store section. It is even possible to serve
the same data with a different appearance in different parts of the
site, allowing for co-branding of content.

This is a sample of what a basic loop looks like when coded in
I<Template Toolkit>:

    [% FOREACH item = cart.items %]
    name: [% item.name %]
    price: [% item.price %]
    [% END %]

=head1 Controller Example

Let's walk through a simple Hello World example that illustrates how
the Model-View-Controller pattern is used in our code. We'll start with
the controller code.

    package ESF::Control::Hello;
    use strict;
    use ESF::Control;
    @ESF::Control::Hello::ISA = qw(ESF::Control);
    use ESF::Util;
    sub handler {
        ### do some setup work
        my $class = shift;
        my $apr = ESF::Util->get_request();
        
        ### instantiate the model
        my $name = $apr->param('name');
        
        # we create a new Model::Hello object.
        my $hello = ESF::Model::Hello-E<gt>new(NAME =E<gt> $name);
        
        ### send out the view
        my $view_data{'hello'} = $hello->view();
        
        # the process_template() method is inherited
        # from the ESF::Control base class
        $class->process_template(
                TEMPLATE => 'hello.html',
                DATA     => \%view_data);
    }

In addition to the things you see here, there are a few interesting
details about the C<ESF::Control> base class. All requests are
dispatched to the C<ESF::Control-E<gt>run()> method first, which wraps
them in a C<try{}> block before calling the appropriate C<handler()>
method. It also provides the C<process_template()> method, which runs
C<Template Toolkit> and then sends out the results with appropriate
HTTP headers. If the Controller specifies it, the headers can include
C<Last-Modified> and C<Expires>, for control of page caching by the
proxy servers.

Now let's look at the corresponding Model code.

    package ESF::Model::Hello;
    use strict;
    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my %args = @_;
        my $self = bless {}, $class;
        $self{'name'} = $args{'NAME'} || 'World';
        return $self;
    }
    
    sub view {
        # the object itself will work for the view
        return shift;
    }

This is a very simple Model object. Most Model objects would have some
database and cache interaction. They would include a C<load()> method
which accepts an ID and loads the appropriate object state from the
database. Model objects that can be modified by the application would
also include a C<save()> method.

Note that because of Perl's flexible OO style, it is not necessary to
call C<new()> when loading an object from the database. The C<load()>
and C<new()> methods can both be constructors for use in different
circumstances, both returning a blessed reference.

The C<load()> method typically handles cache management as well as
database access. Here's some pseudo-code showing a typical C<load()>
method:

    sub load {
        my $class = shift;
        my %args = @_;
        my $id = $args{'ID'};
        my $self;
        unless ($self = _fetch_from_cache($id)) {
            $self = _fetch_from_database($id);
            $self->_store_in_cache();
        }
        return $self;
    }

The save method would use the same approach in reverse, saving first
to the cache and then to the database.

One final thing to notice about our Model class is the C<view()>
method. This method exists to give the object an opportunity to
shuffle it's data around or create a separate data structure that is
easier for use with a template. This can be used to hide a complex
implementation from the template coders. For example, remember the
partitioning of the product inventory data that we did to allow for
separate cache expiration times? The product Model object is really a
faE<ccedil>ade for several underlying implementation objects, but the
C<view()> method on that class consolidates the data for use by the
templates.

To finish off our Hello World example, we need a template to render
the view. This one will do the job:

    <html>
    <title>Hello, My Oyster</title>
    <body>
        [% PROCESS header.html %]
        Hello [% hello.name %]!
        [% PROCESS footer.html %]
    </body>
    </html>

=head1 Performance Tuning

Since Perl code executes so quickly under C<mod_perl>, the performance
bottleneck is usually at the database. We applied all the documented
tricks for improving C<DBD::Oracle> performance. We used bind
variables, C<prepare_cached()>, C<Apache::DBI>, and adjustments to the
C<RowCache> buffer size.

The big win of course is avoiding going to the database in the first
place. The caching work we did had a huge impact on performance.
Fetching product data from the I<Berkeley DB> cache was about ten
times faster than fetching it from the database. Serving a product
page from the proxy cache was about ten times faster than generating
it on the application server from cached data. Clearly the site would
never have survived under heavy load without the caching.

Partitioning the data objects was also a big win. We identified
several different subsets of product data that could be loaded and
cached independently. When an application needed product data, it
could specify which subset was required and skip loading the
unnecessary data from the database.

Another standard performance technique we followed was avoiding
unnecessary object creation. The C<Template> object is created the
first time it's used and then cached for the life of the Apache
process. Socket connections to search servers are cached in a way
similar to what C<Apache::DBI> does for database
connections. Resources that are used frequently within the scope of a
request, such as database handles and session objects, were cached in
C<mod_perl>'s C<$r-E<gt>pnotes()> until the end of the request.

=head1 Trap: Nested Exceptions

When trying out a new technology like the C<Error> module, there are
bound to be some things to watch out for. We found a certain code
structure that causes a memory leak every time it is executed. It
involves nested C<try{}> blocks, and looks like this:

    my $foo;
    try {
        # some stuff...
        try {
            $foo++;
            # more stuff...
        } catch Error with {
            # handle error
        };
    
    } catch Error with {
        # handle other error
    };

It's not Graham Barr's fault that this leaks; it is simply a
by-product of the fact that the C<try> and C<catch> keywords are
implemented using anonymous subroutines. This code is equivalent to
the following:

    my $foo;
    $subref1 = sub {
        $subref2 = sub {
            $foo++;
        };
    };

This nested subroutine creates a closure for C<$foo> and will make a
new copy of the variable every time it is executed. The situation is
easy to avoid once you know to watch out for it.

=head2 Berkeley DB

One of the big wins in our architecture was the use of I<Berkeley DB>.
Since most people are not familiar with it's more advanced features,
we'll give a brief overview here.

The C<DB_File> module is part of the standard Perl distribution.
However, it only supports the interface of I<Berkeley DB> version
1.85, and doesn't include the interesting features of later
releases. To get those, you'll need the C<BerkeleyDB.pm> module,
available from CPAN.  This module can be tricky to build, but
comprehensive instructions are included.

Newer versions of I<Berkeley DB> offer many features that help
performance in a C<mod_perl> environment. To begin with, database
files can be opened once at the start of the program and kept open,
rather than opened and closed on every request. I<Berkeley DB> will
use a shared memory buffer to improve data access speed for all
processes using the database. Concurrent access is directly supported
with locking handled for you by the database. This is a huge win over
C<DB_File>, which requires you to do your own locking. Locks can be at
a database level, or at a memory page level to allow multiple
simultaneous writers. Transactions with rollback capability are also
supported.

This all sounds too good to be true, but there are some downsides. The
documentation is somewhat sparse, and you will probably need to refer
to the C API if you need to understand how to do anything complicated.

A more serious problem is database corruption. When an Apache process
using I<Berkeley DB> dies from a hard kill or a segfault, it can
corrupt the database. A corrupted database will sometimes cause
subsequent opening attempts to hang. According to the people we talked
to at Sleepycat Software (which provides commercial support for
I<Berkeley DB>), this can happen even with the transactional mode of
operation. They are working on a way to fix the problem. In our case,
none of the data stored in the cache was essential for operation so we
were able to simply clear it out when restarting an application
server.

Another thing to watch out for is deadlocks. If you use the page-level
locking option, you have to handle deadlocks. There is a daemon
included in the distribution that will watch for deadlocks and fix
them, or you can handle them yourself using the C API.

After trying a few different things, we recommend that you use
database-level locking. It's much simpler, and cured our problems. We
didn't see any significant performance hit from switching to this mode
of locking. The one thing you need to watch out for when using
exclusive database level write locks are long operations with cursors
that tie up the database. We split up some of our operations into
multiple writes in order to avoid this problem.

If you have a good C coder on your team, you may want to try the
alternate approach that we finally ended up with. You can write your
own daemon around I<Berkeley DB> and use it in a client/server style
over Unix sockets. This allows you to catch signals and ensure a safe
shutdown. You can also write your own deadlock handling code this way.

=head1 Valuable Tools

If you plan to do any serious Perl development, you should really take
the time to become familiar with some of the available development
tools. The debugger in particular is a lifesaver, and it works with
C<mod_perl>. There is a profiler called C<Devel::DProf>, which also
works with C<mod_perl>. It's definitely the place to start when
performance tuning your application.

We found the ability to run our complete system on individual's
workstations to be extremely useful. Everyone could develop on his own
machine, and coordinate changes using I<CVS> source control.

For object modeling and design, we used the open source C<Dia> program
and I<Rational Rose>. Both support working with UML and are great for
generating pretty class diagrams for your cubicle walls.

=head1 Do Try This at Home

Since we started this project, a number of development frameworks that
offer support for this kind of architecture have come out. We don't
have direct experience using these, but they have a similar design and
may prove useful to you if you want to take an MVC approach with your
system.

C<Apache::PageKit> is a C<mod_perl> module available from CPAN which
provides a basic MVC structure for web applications. It uses the
C<HTML::Template> module for building views.

I<OpenInteract> is a recently released web application framework in
Perl, which works together with the persistence layer C<SPOPS>. Both
are available from CPAN.

The I<Application Toolkit> from Extropia is a comprehensive set of
Perl classes for building web apps. It has excellent documentation and
takes good advantage of existing CPAN modules. You can find it on
http://www.extropia.com/.

If you want a ready-to-use cache module, take a look at the Perl-cache
project on http://sourceforge.net/. This is the next generation of the
popular C<File::Cache> module.

The Java world has many options as well. The I<Struts> framework, part
of the I<Jakarta> project, is a good open source choice. There are
also commercial products from several vendors that follow this sort of
design. Top contenders include I<ATG Dynamo>, I<BEA WebLogic>, and
I<IBM WebSphere>.

=head1 An Open Source Success Story

By building on the open source software and community, we were able to
create a top-tier web site with a minimum of cost and effort. The
system we ended up with is scalable to huge amounts of traffic. It
runs on mostly commodity hardware making it easy to grow when the need
arises. Perhaps best of all, it provided tremendous learning
opportunities for our developers, and made us a part of the larger
development community.

We've contributed patches from our work back to various open source
projects, and provided help on mailing lists. We'd like to take this
opportunity to officially thank the open source developers who
contributed to projects mentioned here. Without them, this would not
have been possible. We also have to thank the hardworking web
developers at eToys. The store may be closed, but the talent that
built it lives on.
