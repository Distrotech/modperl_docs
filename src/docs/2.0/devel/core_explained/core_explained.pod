=head1 ...

most of the xs/ *.h files have code in them.  they are .h because they are
always #include-d, never compiled into their own object file.  and only
the file that #include-s a .h file from xs/ should be able to see what's
in there.  anything else belongs in a src/modules/perl/foo.c public api.
