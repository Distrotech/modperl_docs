2.0 docs todo:

*** Areas that would be nice to document first ***

- Automatic API docs generator from .h files
  Owner: Lyle Brooks?

- Directive handlers (custom config handlers)
  Owner: stas

*** General items ***

Add a note somewhere that explains the layout of the documentation, in
particular:

 api/ - documents the API, fully covering all options.

 user/ and devel/ are tutorials and don't necessarely cover all the
 features of a discussed module. but should instead point to the API
 manpage for a complete info.

The point is that we want to avoid duplication of the documenation, in
order to make it easier to maintain the docs and keep them in sync.

under

  SetHandler modperl

the

  Options +SetupEnv

has no effect. Instead either use perl-script or call
$r->subprocess_env in the void context.

On the cleanups from Bill Rowe's email (need to integrate this into
the cleanup docs, the hook that we don't have yet):

Cleanups are a LIFO stack.  When a pool is freed, first all sub-pools
are freed.  Then all cleanups within that pool are run (the cleanups
in the sub-pool already ran when those sub-pools were freed.)

So if you register a cleanup, then create an apr object in the same
pool, those apr object's cleanup runs before your registered cleanup.

If you create an apr object and register your own cleanup, you still
have that object until your registered cleanup is finished.
