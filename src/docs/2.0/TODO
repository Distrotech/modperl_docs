2.0 docs todo:

---

Add a note somewhere that explains the layout of the documentation, in
particular:

 api/ - documents the API, fully covering all options.

 user/ and devel/ are tutorials and don't necessarely cover all the
 features of a discussed module. but should instead point to the API
 manpage for a complete info.

The point is that we want to avoid duplication of the documenation, in
order to make it easier to maintain the docs and keep them in sync.

under

  SetHandler modperl

the

  Options +SetupEnv

has no effect. Instead either use perl-script or call
$r->subprocess_env in the void context.
