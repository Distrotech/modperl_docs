alt="Running Weblogs with Slash">

Slash (http://www.slashcode.org/) is the open-source software system
that drives the hugely popular Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org/) web
site and many others. Slash implements the kind of web site that has
come to be called a "weblog": a moderated list, in
reverse-chronological order, of timely items, with links to further
discussion on-site, or to further information off-site. Anyone who
wants to get a weblog site up and running will want to read I<Running
Weblogs with Slash>.

Slash, like all good things, runs under mod_perl.

See http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash/.
