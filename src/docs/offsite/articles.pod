 META: more articles are welcome

=head1 Are You Interested in Publishing Your Own mod_perl Article?

We always welcome new mod_perl articles. Here are some steps to help you
out.

First, you should find out if your information might be better suited
as documentation for mod_perl. We try to maintain a big knowledge base
here, and additions are always welcome. Please contact L<the docs-dev
mailing
list|maillist::docs-dev> with patches or additions.

For the content, we advocate reuse. If you're writing installation
instructions, you are free to get as much inspiration as you want from
the documentation on this site, especially the user guides. You should
always try and re-write it a little to add your own touch or more
user-friendliness, but you may keep the same steps and
information. After all, there's only one way to install it, and it's
pretty well documented already! This is true for all other aspects
covered here too. Of course, if you feel like you have created
something useful for everyone, feel free to send it back to us so that
we can re-enter it into our documentation base.

Last, but not least, when you do publish your article, please notify us,
so that we can make a notice of it here!
