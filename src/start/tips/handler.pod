Content Handler Example

=head1 Creating a content handler with mod_perl 1.x

Handlers are simply perl subroutines called by the server at various
stages of the HTTP request cycle.  A content handler is a subroutine
that is called by the response phase.  Handlers, are typically created
as a perl modules, separate files store in a library, and accessable
via perl's C<@INC> array.

For example, here's an example that returns a greeting and the current
local time.

  file:My/Greeting.pm
  -------------------
  package My::Greeting;
  use strict;
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my $now = scalar localtime;
      my $server_name = $r->server->server_hostname;
  
      $r->send_http_header('text/plain');
  
      print <<EOT;
  Thanks for visiting $server_name.
  The local time is $now.
  EOT
  
      return Apache::Constants::OK;
  }
  1; # modules must return true


Save the above as a file file in your perl library
(e.g. I<My/Greeting.pm>a).  Now, to return the above greeting when the
URL I</hello> is visited on your server:

  <location /hello>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler My::Greeting
  </location>

For a more in-depth explanation of creating mod_perl handlers see

Guide|"../../docs/1.0/guide/index.html"> is also recommended reading.
