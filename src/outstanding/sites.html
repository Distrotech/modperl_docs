<h3>Sites Running mod_perl</h3> 
<hr>
This document contains information to give you an idea of where and
more importantly, <b>how</b> mod_perl is being used.  If you have an
interesting mod_perl application, let <a
href="../maillist/list-docs-dev.html">us</a> know about it!
<p>
Of course, the sites described on this page are not the only sites
running mod_perl.  Since mod_perl has inserted it's name and version
into Apache's Server header, we are able to see others based on the 
<a href="netcraft/">netcraft survey</a> results.

The first public site to run mod_perl and the hand that feeds CPAN
with it, <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html">PAUSE</a>, the Perl Authors Upload SErver.  This was a birthday present given
to PAUSE by <b>Andreas K&ouml;nig</b> on August 20, 1996.
</p>
<p>

Andreas and <b>Kulturbox</b> went on to create an exciting site with
mod_perl that gives you a 
dynamic tour of Berlin, Germany.
<a href="http://www.kulturbox.de/perl/berlininfo">BerlinINFO</a>.  The images you see here are generated on the fly, 
using mod_perl allows the <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/GD/">GD</a> image objects to be cached in memory
for an extra performance boost.
</p>
<p>

Do you like movies?  Then take a look at how <b>Rob Hartill</b> uses mod_perl 
to help you find out anything and everything there is to know about movies
at the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/"> Internet Movie Database </a>.
Besides using mod_perl to speed up the interactive database queries, 
mod_perl steps in during the first stage of a request, mapping URIs to 
cached query results if present and mapping based on language preference if
the user has presented one.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.webpersonals.com/">Webpersonals</a> site uses
<code>HTML::Embperl</code> over mod_perl to drive this nice match
making site.
</p>


<p> 
<a href="http://conceptionstore.com">Conceptionstore.com</a>'s <a
href="http://dev.cogenttechnology.com/epl/csovucalcin.html">ovulation
calendar</a> runs on HTML::Embperl over mod_perl.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://hn.org">Hammernode Internet</a> a no-cost DNS provider
serving thousands of zones, uses mod_perl to power both its dynamic
web site, as well as the server end of its published API interface for
client programs.  We're very satisfied with mod_perl, and very
thankful for it.
</p>

The Internet's largest on-line toy store, <a
href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys.com</a>, uses mod_perl extensively.
We use an object-oriented approach built on standard CPAN modules such
as DBI, BerkeleyDB, and Template Toolkit.  eToys ranked third in
overall traffic among e-commerce sites during the 1999 Christmas rush,
right behind Amazon and eBay.

<b>Patrick Kane</b> uses mod_perl at 
<a href="http://www.enews.com/">The Electronic Newsstand</a> to maintain
limited and persistent connections to their Sybase servers where users
can search and browse through thousands of virtual magazines.  Patrick
also uses mod_perl's Authentication hook for seamlessly migrating users
from their old registration system to a new one.

<a href="http://www.sol.no/">Scandinavia Online AS</a> uses
mod_perl for the <a href="http://kvasir.sol.no/">Kvasir search
engine</a>.  <b>Kvasir</b> is Norway's most popular Internet directory.
</p>
<p>



<b>Alvar Freude</b> uses mod_perl on <a
href="http://www.a-blast.org/">http://www.a-blast.org/</a>.  It is a
"truly interactive text network", written completely in mod_perl. For
a quick, non-technical overview have a look on <a
href="http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/prixars/">http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/prixars/</a>.
(its in english on our old domain).<br>
About one year ago, it runs on M$ IIS with ActivePerl and some PHP, in
the meantime it is completely rewritten as Apache module, using MySQL as
database. With this, I speed up the execution time from ~3 Seconds to
~10 milliseconds for each Blast-Page (OK, OK, the old machine had a very
worst hardware, now we use only a semi-worst one: Pentium II 350, 320 MB
RAM with Soft-RAID 0 under Linux).<br>

The blast_engine includes the links into the texts in realtime, also
the statistics are created in realtime:<br> <a
href="http://www.a-blast.org/statistics/">http://www.a-blast.org/statistics/</a>,
<a
href="http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/statistik">http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/statistik/</a>
(german, with much more traffic)

The blaster uses the speed benefit of keeping the complete keyword
list in memory (more then 5 MB for the german version), for the
non-linear real-time linker I use a ~50 line regexp .-) The HTML-Files
are compressed on-the-fly with Compress::Zlib, so we keep bandwidth
(and transmission time to the users) small.

<A HREF="http://www.citysearch.com/">CitySearch.com</A> -- is
providing online city guides for more than 100 cities worldwide,
citysearch.com helps people find and plan what they want to do and
then lets them take action, offering local transactions such as buying
event tickets and making hotel and restaurant reservations online. Its
traffic exceeds 100,000,000 page views a month. Of course it's running
under mod_perl.


<A HREF="http://perlmonth.com">PerlMonth</A> is a site completely driven  
by mod_perl/mySQL. Every article is stored in the database. When a user
makes a request, a module we wrote parses the uri and dynamically creates  
the html page for the user. It's nothing out of the ordinary but it helps
maintain the overall site with ease. PerlMonth does about 100K
Pageviews/month w/o breaking a sweat. The site is written and 
maintaned by <B>Baiju Thakkar</B>.
</p>
<p>


<A HREF="http://singlesheaven.com">singlesheaven.com</A> is a match
maker site, that is written completely in Perl and is being driven by
Apache/mod_perl and mysql. Each request comprises a big number of
database queries to make the site very interactive, and it's still
very fast under mod_perl.  The service runs under
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> module. The site is written and
maintained by <B>Stas Bekman</B>.

<a href="http://www.filepile.com/">filepile.com</a> is an archive of
over 1.2 million freeware/shareware files.  <b>Michael Mittelstadt</b> explains:
"After moving to mod_perl, everything is wonderful, everything is
fast, and the computer (dual P6, linux) is no longer bending under 
the stress.  mod_perl saved us from having to buy a second webserver."

<b>Gerald Richter</b> and <b>ECOS</b> are using mod_perl (with
Embperl) for a picture database. This contains 
pictures from touristic information Rheinland-Pfalz. It's intented as press
information, to reduce the need of sending photographs around. You can view
and search the picture via the <a
href="http://bilder.ecos.de">internet</a> or via a 
direct dial-in. The download is only available for vaild users and via
direct dial-in. Also it's possible to maintain the database via the web and
insert new picture and descriptions, change or delete them.
Software running is Apache 1.3, mod_perl,
<a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/">Embperl</a>, DBI, DBD-Pg, Postgress
6.21 on an Linux 2.0.34.

<b>Jayme Cox</b> explains: At <b>Broderbund Software</b>, we have a
site running mod_perl to keep 
persistant database connections open between our Apache web farm and
our
Oracle database server. We have a <a href="http://www.warlords3.com">
game site </a> that checks our Oracle DB for a customers email address
and lets them download additional game maps if they have registered
the software. Using persistant DB connections increased the perceived
response time by over
200%. The exact URL is

<b>Rick Mangi</b> and 
<a href="http://www.tgix.com/">Thaumaturgix, Inc.</a>
use mod_perl to provide a method for gathering stats on web
usage including a logging proxy server module for their customers.

<p>

<b>Jason Bodnar</b> at <b>Cox Interactive Media</b>, explains: <br>
Right now we're using mod_perl for authentication on two sites (soon
to be a third): 
<a href="http://www.Austin360.com">http://www.Austin360.com</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.GoBig12.com">http://www.GoBig12.com</a>. 
We started out using Netscape servers and dbms for authentication. We
were writing all our demographic info to flat files but that got out
of hand so we moved the demo info to Informix. This was okay but it
meant keeping two seperate databases (dbms or Berkely DB with
username/password and Informix with demographics). Not fun. So when we
switched to Apache (for performance reasons) I was able to consolidate
all the info and do authentication out of Informix thanks to mod_perl,
Apache::DBI, Apache::AuthenDBI and DBD::Informix. It makes life much
simpler!  We're also eventually going to be running our Eats Database
(list over 1400 restaurants in Austin) and our movie database with
mod_perl. I'm sure we'll find alot more uses for it in the future.

<A HREF="http://www.magirus.com">Magirus Datentechnik GmbH</A> 
is a German company of about 200 peoples, (de)located in 
Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and needs a powerful 
Intranet System for it's internal information flows.  We're 
using mod_perl to do it.  Our mod_perl applications make the 
link between 5 different database systems (Perl power and 
mod_perl permanent database connections), allow users to get 
price-lists, make offers and orders, get the status of a 
client, etc. The advantage of that kind of configuration is 
that we just need to install a Web Browser on the user's side. 
These tools are avaible from both Intranet or secured Internet 
connection. Without mod_perl, the average response time for 
the top 5 applications is between 3 till 9 seconds.  This can't 
be accepted by an end-user.  With mod_perl, the response time 
seems (for the end-user) to be null (depending of the client's 
speed).  This is only working on a private-network and so we 
can't give you an address to try it.  For more information,

<b>Tony Bowden</b> developed <a href="http://www.musicdatabase.com/">The
Music Database</a> which uses mod_perl and MySQL to allow browsing and
searching a cross-referenced guide to over 80,000 CDs and one million
songs. (not operational at this stage).

<b>Randy Ray</b> uses Apache+mod_perl for his Software Configuration Management
team's site within <b>U S WEST IT</b>. About 1/3 of the data the server sends out is
CGI-generated. After the conversion to mod_perl, some existing CGI scripts
running unchanged via Apache::Registry showed measurable speed increases of
as much as 723%. All of the SCM CGI scripts use the Image::Size library to
add HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to &lt;IMG&gt; tags. As Image::Size caches the
dimensions of each files as it is first read, the persistent dataspace will
virtually eliminate the step of computing image sizes.

<a href="http://www.arttoday.com">ArtToday</a> has a collection of
over 600,000 keyworded images of all types.  Customers find images
using keyword and category searches.  They serve about 250,000 raw
hits daily.

Information about the collection persists in an Oracle 7 database,
and keyword searches happen via a custom application written using
a Verity search engine.  All of this is glued together using Perl.
Our hardware consists of a single Sun Ultra with lots of storage
(about 150GB) and an unnecessarily large monitor.

We switched to Apache/mod_perl after becoming frustrated with
Netscape Commerce Server performance.  Although I don't have hard
numbers, I would estimate a factor of 2-5 times CGI performance.
Using mod_perl and Apache we've turned our "extremely loaded" server
into a "comfortably loaded" server, even allowing us room for some
software development.  Mod_perl saved us from having to buy another
Ultra!

These scripts query an mSQL database via various criteria, and employ 
the CPAN multiplexer code to choose a nearby mirror of the archive, 
if available and desired.

<A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS Online</A> is using mod_perl to
improve the speed of its heavily loaded servers, having replaced CGI for
games, navigation control, and commerce.

<p>

<a href='http://www.oreilly.com/'>O'Reilly and Associates</a>
uses mod_perl to control access to their
<a href='http://online-books.oreilly.com/books/'>online books site</a>.
Every request for a document runs through a mod_perl script, which checks
username and password, and may eventually provide dynamic data.

<a href="http://home.wired.com/">WIRED Digital</a>
uses mod_perl (on linux and solaris) for several
applications. On HotBot  mod_perl is used for the <a
href="http://members.hotbot.com/">HotBot mail and 
HotBot homepages</a> application, interfacing with a third-party
application by WhoWhere.  It is also used widely throughout 
<a href="http://www.hotwired.com/">HotWired</a>,
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/">Wired News</a>,
<a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/"> Webmonkey </a>
and <a href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck.com </a> as a replacement for
CGI scripts, 
and to control the HotWired member pages.  Mod_perl also runs two
servers that redirect requests for external pages from within WIRED
sites.  WIRED Digital regards mod_perl as an important and highly
valuable addition to the server development toolset, and will continue
to consider mod_perl as a strong candidate for solutions.

<a href="http://www.medimatch.com/">MediMatch</a> uses Apache and
Stronghold on Solaris, and makes use of mod_perl almost exclusively
for its medical employment services database.  Originally coded to use
standard CGI, when we switched over to mod_perl to maintain persistent
connections to a Sybase database, and for data caching in various
fashions, we saw a speedup ranging from 25-500% (varying on the type
and depth of the search queries).  We also use mod_perl to facilitate
the caching of CGI-parsed HTML pages, which reduced the speed of
requests to approximately that of ordinary static HTML. 
</p>
<p>

CMPnet <a href="http://www.cmpnet.com/">www.cmpnet.com</a>, a
technology information network, uses 
mod_perl to generate 70% of its pages - over half a million hits a day.
Our network includes TechWeb <a
href="http://www.techweb.com/">www.techweb.com</a>, a technology 
news site, and FileMine 
<a href="http://www.filemine.com/">www.filemine.com</a>, a shareware
site. 
We switched to mod_perl because we couldn't stand writing and
debugging NSAPI code for Netscape servers anymore. Needless to say the
productivity improvement was immeasurable. Recently our company
evaluated several top commercial web publishing platforms (Vignette's
StoryServer, INSO's DynaBase) for a possible switchover. But in the
end we stayed with our mod_perl architecture and agreed to standardize
our company's internet operations on it!

Mark A. Downing tells us:
I have been running an <a href="http://www.wm7d.net/">Amateur
Radio</a> callsign database (with 800k records)
on my web page for nearly two years, originally with WebSQL. But due to the
lack of portability, I rewrote my scripts using sybperl. Now with mod_perl,
I have successfully cut the time to complete a lookup from nearly 5 seconds
to under 1 second (It takes longer to display the data than to do the
query). This was accomplished by creating persistant database connections
(to sybase) using mod_perl, and Apache is now able to establish those
connections upon startup. No longer do I have to wait for my original
scripts to connect and gather data.

Rob Malda tells that <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</a> -
news for nerd, is a combination of Perl and MySQL. Slashdot runs under
mod_perl which keeps things nice and speedy.

<a href="http://www.mojam.com/">Mojam</a> is a new Internet music
media company with the goal of attracting the largest audience of
music listeners and players anywhere.  Mojam is different that
RollingStone or MTV because it focuses on helping new bands get their
music out to the listeners by posting thier show dates, music clips,
and news releases.  mojam.com is 100% Apache mod_perl running Mason to
dynamically deliver all of it's pages.
