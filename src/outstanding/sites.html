    sites enjoying mod_perl">

<p>
This document contains information to give you an idea of where and
more importantly, <b>how</b> mod_perl is being used.  If you have an
interesting mod_perl application, let <a
href="../maillist/docs-dev.html">us</a> know about it!
</p>

<p> Of course, the sites described on this page are not the only sites
running mod_perl. Since mod_perl inserts its name and version into
Apache's <tt>Server</tt> header, we are able to see others based on
the <a href="stats/netcraft.html">Netcraft survey</a> results.
</p>

<p>
Also remember that many services are using mod_perl as their
back-end, therefore these aren't reported by Netcraft, since the
back-ends are usually cannot be accessed by the Netcraft scanner. For
the same reason, if you try to verify whether some of the services
listed here are running mod_perl, you may not be able to, because the
back-end is not accessible. The listing is made of reports from people
who develop and maintain these services, so they know.
</p>


<p> In addition to the sites listed in this document, you might also
be interested in the sites running these application toolkits/servers
using mod_perl: </p>

<p> <b>Helping out Perl developers:</b> The first public site to run
mod_perl was <a href="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a>, the Perl
Authors Upload SErver.  This was a birthday present given to PAUSE by
Andreas K&ouml;nig on August 20, 1996.  </p>

<p> Many other sites helpful for Perl developers are using
mod_perl. Search engines like <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/">Search.cpan.org</a> and <a
href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/">Randy Kobes' CPAN search</a> use
mod_perl. This is also the case for the popular <a
href="http://use.perl.org/">Use Perl</a> and <a
href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perl Monastery</a> web sites. The <a
href="http://nntp.perl.org/">Perl.org news server</a>'s web interface
also uses mod_perl, as well as the <a
href="http://jobs.perl.org/">Perl jobs site</a> (which is also where
we get our mod_perl jobs listing from). </p>

<p> <b>Movies/music: </b> Take a look at how Rob Hartill uses
mod_perl to help you find out anything and everything there is to know
about movies at the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie
Database</a>.  Besides using mod_perl to speed up the interactive
database queries, mod_perl steps in during the first stage of a
request, mapping URIs to cached query results if present and mapping
based on language preference if the user has presented one. See <a
href="success_stories/imdb.com.html">the success story</a>.
</p>

<p> Mark A. Downing tells us: I have been running an <a
href="http://www.wm7d.net/">Amateur Radio</a> callsign database (with
800k records) on my web page for nearly two years, originally with
WebSQL. But due to the lack of portability, I rewrote my scripts using
sybperl. Now with mod_perl, I have successfully cut the time to
complete a lookup from nearly 5 seconds to under 1 second (It takes
longer to display the data than to do the query). This was
accomplished by creating persistant database connections (to sybase)
using mod_perl, and Apache is now able to establish those connections
upon startup. No longer do I have to wait for my original scripts to
connect and gather data.  </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.mojam.com/">Mojam</a> is a new Internet music
media company with the goal of attracting the largest audience of
music listeners and players anywhere.  Mojam is different that
RollingStone or MTV because it focuses on helping new bands get their
music out to the listeners by posting their show dates, music clips,
and news releases.  mojam.com is 100% Apache mod_perl running Mason to
dynamically deliver all of it's pages.  </p>

<b>Technology news: </b><a href="http://home.wired.com/">WIRED
Digital</a> uses mod_perl (on linux and solaris) for several
applications.  It is used widely throughout <a
href="http://www.hotwired.com/">HotWired</a>, <a
href="http://www.wired.com/news/">Wired News</a>, <a
href="http://www.webmonkey.com/"> Webmonkey </a> and <a
href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck.com </a> as a replacement for CGI
scripts, and to control the HotWired member pages.  Mod_perl also runs
two servers that redirect requests for external pages from within
WIRED sites.  WIRED Digital regards mod_perl as an important and
highly valuable addition to the server development toolset, and will
continue to consider mod_perl as a strong candidate for solutions.

</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.cmpnet.com/">CMPNet</a>, a technology
information network, uses mod_perl to generate 70% of its pages - over
half a million hits a day.  Our network includes <a
href="http://www.techweb.com/">TechWeb</a>, a technology news site.
We switched to mod_perl because we couldn't stand writing and
debugging NSAPI code for Netscape servers anymore. Needless to say the
productivity improvement was immeasurable. Recently our company
evaluated several top commercial web publishing platforms (Vignette's
StoryServer, INSO's DynaBase) for a possible switchover. But in the
end we stayed with our mod_perl architecture and agreed to standardize
our company's internet operations on it!  </p>

<p> Rob Malda tells us that <a
href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> - "News for Nerds", uses a
combination of Perl and MySQL. Slashdot runs under mod_perl (using <a
href="http://www.slashcode.org/">SlashCode</a>) which keeps things
nice and speedy.  </p>

<p> <b>Macromedia: </b> The creators of Flash and other interesting
web technologies and programs use mod_perl for <a
href="http://www.macromedia.com/">their website</a>.</p>

<p>

<b>Search engine: </b> <a href="http://www.sol.no/">Scandinavia
Online</a> uses mod_perl for the <a
href="http://kvasir.sol.no/">Kvasir search engine</a>.  Kvasir is
Norway's most popular Internet directory.

</p>

<p>mod_perl scripts which search the archives of <a
href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/cpan-search.html">CPAN</a>, <a
href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/ctan-search.html">CTAN</a>, <A
href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/linux-search.html">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/tetex.html">teTeX</a> (a
Unix TeX system), and MuPAD (a symbolic math program) are available at
<a href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/">theory.uwinnipeg.ca</a>.  These
scripts query an mSQL database via various criteria, and employ the
CPAN multiplexer code to choose a nearby mirror of the archive, if
available and desired.  </p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.athand.com/">AtHand Network Yellow
pages</a> serve their content thanks to mod_perl.</p>

<b>Picture database:</b> Gerald Richter and ECOS are using mod_perl
(with Embperl) for a picture database. This contains pictures from
touristic information Rheinland-Pfalz. It's intented as press
information, to reduce the need of sending photographs around. You can
view and search the picture via the <a
href="http://bilder.ecos.de">internet</a> or via a direct dial-in. The
download is only available for vaild users and via direct
dial-in. Also it's possible to maintain the database via the web and
insert new pictures and descriptions, change or delete them.  It is
running Apache 1.3, mod_perl, <a
href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/">Embperl</a>, DBI, DBD-Pg,
PostgreSQL 6.21 on Linux 2.0.34.
</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/">www.stonehenge.com</a>
provides an online easy-to-navigate archive of the 150+ magazine
articles written by Perl Hacker Randal Schwartz, along with an
organized collection of the 20,000 pictures he's taken with his
digital camera all over the world, using mod_perl and Template
Toolkit's Splash widget library for rapid development and access.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arttoday.com">ArtToday</a> has a collection of
over 600,000 keyworded images of all types.  Customers find images
using keyword and category searches.  They serve about 250,000 raw
hits daily.

Randy Ray uses Apache+mod_perl for his Software Configuration
Management team's site within US WEST IT. About 1/3 of the data the
server sends out is CGI-generated. After the conversion to mod_perl,
some existing CGI scripts running unchanged via
<tt>Apache::Registry</tt> showed measurable speed increases of as much
as 723%. All of the SCM CGI scripts use the <tt>Image::Size</tt>
library to add <tt>HEIGHT</tt> and <tt>WIDTH</tt> attributes to
<tt>&lt;IMG&gt;</tt> tags. As <tt>Image::Size</tt> caches the
dimensions of each files as it is first read, the persistent dataspace
will virtually eliminate the step of computing image sizes.

<b>City guide:</b> <a
href="http://www.citysearch.com/">CitySearch.com</a> provides online
city guides for more than 100 cities worldwide, citysearch.com helps
people find and plan what they want to do and then lets them take
action, offering local transactions such as buying event tickets and
making hotel and restaurant reservations online. Its traffic exceeds
100,000,000 page views a month. Of course it's running under mod_perl.
</p>

<p> <b>Online communities:</b> <a
href="http://www.webpersonals.com/">Webpersonals</a> uses
<tt>HTML::Embperl</tt> running under mod_perl to drive this nice match
making site.

Alvar Freude uses mod_perl on
<a href="http://www.a-blast.org/">Assoziations-Blaster</a>.  It is a
"truly interactive text network", written completely in mod_perl. For
a quick, non-technical overview take a look <a
href="http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/prixars/">here</a>.

</p>

<p>
About one year ago, it was running on Microsoft IIS with ActivePerl
and some PHP, in the meantime it has been completely rewritten as an
Apache module, using MySQL as a database. With this, I speeded up the
execution time from ~3 Seconds to ~10 milliseconds for each Blast-Page
(OK, OK, the old machine had very bad hardware, now we use only
semi-bad hardware: Pentium II 350, 320 MB RAM with Soft-RAID 0 under
Linux).

</p>

<p>
The blast_engine includes links to the texts in realtime, and the
statistics are created in real time: <a
href="http://www.a-blast.org/statistics/">english version</a>, <a
href="http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/statistik">(german version,
with much more traffic)</a>.
</p>

<p> The blaster uses the speed benefit of keeping the complete keyword
list in memory (more then 5 MB for the german version), for the
non-linear real-time linker I use a ~50 line regexp .-) The HTML files
are compressed on-the-fly with <tt>Compress::Zlib</tt>, so we keep
bandwidth (and transmission time to the users) small.  </p>

Jayme Cox explains that at Broderbund Software, we have a site running
mod_perl to keep persistant database connections open between our
Apache web farm and our Oracle database server. We have a <a
href="http://www.warlords3.com">game site</a> that checks our Oracle
DB for a customers email address and lets them download additional
game maps if they have registered the software. Using persistant DB
connections increased the perceived response time by over 200%.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://members2.fantasy.sportsline.com/">Fantasy
Sports</a> site, which puts you in the position of manager of a group
of athletes, runs mod_perl to server its dynamic content.</p>

<p> <b>Ovulation calendar: </b> <a
href="http://conceptionstore.com">Conceptionstore.com</a>'s <a
href="http://dev.cogenttechnology.com/epl/csovucalcin.html">ovulation
calendar</a> runs on <tt>HTML::Embperl</tt> under mod_perl.
</p>

<p>

<b>DNS provider:</b> <a href="http://hn.org">Hammernode Internet</a>,
a no-cost DNS provider serving thousands of zones, uses mod_perl to
power both its dynamic web site, as well as the server end of its
published API interface for client programs.  "We're very satisfied
with mod_perl, and very thankful for it."
</p>


<p>

<b>Statistics: </b> Rick Mangi and <a
href="http://www.tgix.com/">Thaumaturgix, Inc.</a> use mod_perl to
provide a method for gathering stats on web usage including a logging
proxy server module for their customers.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.valueclick.com/">ValueClick</a>, the well-known
advertising provider, uses mod_perl to serve its advertisements at
high speed while still maintaining good statistics of what is
served.</p>

<b>Authentication: </b> Jason Bodnar at Cox Interactive Media,
explains: Right now we're using mod_perl for authentication on two
sites (soon to be a third): <a
href="http://www.Austin360.com">Austin360</a> and <a
href="http://www.GoBig12.com">GoBig12</a>.  We started out using
Netscape servers and dbms for authentication. We were writing all our
demographic info to flat files but that got out of hand so we moved
the demo info to Informix. This was okay but it meant keeping two
seperate databases (dbms or Berkely DB with username/password and
Informix with demographics). Not fun. So when we switched to Apache
(for performance reasons) I was able to consolidate all the info and
do authentication out of Informix thanks to mod_perl,
<tt>Apache::DBI</tt>, <tt>Apache::AuthenDBI</tt> and
<tt>DBD::Informix</tt>. It makes life much simpler!  We're also
eventually going to be running our Eats Database (list over 1400
restaurants in Austin) and our movie database with mod_perl. I'm sure
we'll find alot more uses for it in the future.

<b>Link between 5 different database systems: </b> <a
href="http://www.magirus.com">Magirus Datentechnik GmbH</a> is a
German company employing around 200 people.  Magirus has offices
located in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and needs a powerful
Intranet System for it's internal information flows. We're using
mod_perl to do it. Our mod_perl applications make the link between 5
different database systems (Perl power and mod_perl permanent database
connections) to allow users to get price-lists, make offers and
orders, get the status of a client, etc.  A principle advantage of
this kind of configuration is that we only need to install a Web
Browser on the user's side. These tools are available from both
Intranet or secured Internet connection. Without mod_perl, the average
response time for the top 5 applications is between 3 and 9
seconds. This is unacceptable to our end-users. With mod_perl, the
response time seems (for the end-user) to be immediate (depending of
the client's speed). This is only working on a private-network and so
we can't give you an address to try it. For more information, contact
<a href="mailto:Philippe.Froidevaux@magirus.com">
Philippe Froidevaux</a>.
</p>

<p> Information about the collection persists in an Oracle 7 database,
and keyword searches happen via a custom application written using a
Verity search engine.  All of this is glued together using Perl.  Our
hardware consists of a single Sun Ultra with lots of storage (about
150GB) and an unnecessarily large monitor.
</p>

<p> We switched to Apache/mod_perl after becoming frustrated with the
Netscape Commerce Server performance.  Although I don't have hard
numbers, I would estimate a factor of 2-5 times CGI performance.
Using mod_perl and Apache we've turned our "extremely loaded" server
into a "comfortably loaded" server, even allowing us room for some
software development.  Mod_perl saved us from having to buy another
Ultra!
</p>

<p> <b>Replacing CGI: </b> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS
Online</a> is using mod_perl to improve the speed of its heavily
loaded servers, having replaced CGI for games, navigation control, and
commerce.
