We've built WebGUI (www.spreadwebgui.com), our web application framework and
content management system, on top of mod_perl. Before we began, in 2001, 
and recently when we started our next gen system we evaluated many 
different platforms on which to build WebGUI. Nothing even comes close 
to mod_perl for flexibility and power.  Developing in Perl also means 
we're able prototype and deploy new features faster than we could in any 
other language.

Today there are more than 15,000 web sites that run on WebGUI, over half of
which are either already running on mod_perl 2.0, or are in the process 
of transitioning to it.  We're so confident about mod_perl 2.0's new 
capabilities and reliability that starting with WebGUI 6.8 we're 
requiring our users to use mod_perl 2.0 going forward.
