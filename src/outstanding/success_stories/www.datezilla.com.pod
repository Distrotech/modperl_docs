  DateZilla.com is a directory of dating, matchmaking and matrimonials
  services and resources. The site is built on mod_perl and HTML::Mason,
  with a MySQL database. The speed of mod_perl and MySQL, combined with
  the sophisticated caching available in Mason, make the site very fast
  despite running on a bargain basement server. The management backend
  (content, ad serving, affiliate management, user stats) is also built
  on the mod_perl/Mason/MySQL combo, and allows a large site to be
  maintained by a small team from the comfort of their laptops.
