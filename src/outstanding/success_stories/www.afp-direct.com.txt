Subject: News agency uses mod_perl for their online system with over 6.5 million stories
URL: http://www.afp-direct.com

http://www.afp-direct.com hosts the Agence France-Presse's online
database of news stories and photographs. Agence France-Presse is the
world's third largest news agency. The online database, available
through subscription, contains over 6.5 million stories and
photographs in a full-text searchable database. The web site makes the
most of mod_perl and its array of modules such as persistent
connections to back-end servers and custom authentication.
