  Klassno.by is a belarussian auction site, written in mod_perl. It is
  designed primarily for the users from Belarus, and takes into account
  local specifics. It uses fulltext morphological analysis for indexing
  and searching.
  
  In the hope of a brilliant future with tens queries per second and
  thousands of active lots, mod_perl was selected as a development
  platform in the very beginning. It uses Class::DBI and Template Toolkit,
  self-made MVC framework, and is written in OO Perl. It is running Apache
  1.3/mod_perl, mysql5 with triggers and views where possible, and nginx
  (http://sysoev.ru/nginx) as a frontend http server.
