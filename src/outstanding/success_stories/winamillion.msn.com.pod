  The Microsoft Network promotion running to increase subscribership
  located at http://winamillion.msn.com/ is run on mod_perl.  The
  contest ends at the end of the month, so check it out before then ;-)
  
  Anyhow, the system is currently pounding nearly 10 million hits per
  week to the web pages, of which about 1 million go through mod_perl.
  Each of those accesses runs through on averate 3 SQL queries to a
  MySQL database and 2 references to DB_File databases.
  
  There is no way in heck it would have run without mod_perl.  By the
  way, this is using Squid in accelerator mode, as I described in the
  tuning docs.  Squid handles about 93% of the content (the static and
  mostly static stuff).
