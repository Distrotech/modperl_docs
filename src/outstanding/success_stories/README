WARNING: All the *.pod files are autogenerated, do not edit them
directly!  Instead, adjust the corresponding .txt files.

After applying modifications, make sure to run:

  % ./make.pl file.txt file2.txt ...

or to run all files

  % ./make.pl

This run will generate .pod files and link them to the main index.

Don't forget to add both files (.txt and the generated .pod) to svn
