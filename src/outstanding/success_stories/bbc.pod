  We have been running ModPerl to deliver dynamic applications as part of
  bbc.co.uk for the past 4 years. At present we have well over 50
  applications ( and growing ) using Modperl and based on the
  Apache::Registry framework. These include community, message boards,
  games, voting, quizzes, searches and listings applications. It serves a
  sustained 500 application requests per second using a distributed
  architecture.
  
  As we have adopted Apache 2.* on our head-end servers we will next be
  looking at how Modperl 2.* can help us in our application layer.
