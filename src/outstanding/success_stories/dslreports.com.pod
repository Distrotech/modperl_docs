 http://dslreports.com pages are entirely modperl, I do almost a
 million pageviews per day, and each page is from 20 to 200 sql
 statements.. and entirely produced by modperl, not templates or
 anything. most pages are produced in less than 200ms.. all the 150
 internal forums as well (10000 posted messages per day and over 2
 million messages online and searchable) are modperl. Everything is
 modperl :)
 

 I use two modperl servers, one sql server, and one frontend (mod
 proxy) server.. all of them are dual cpu 500-1mhz cpus and from 1-4gig
 of memory..
 

 This is all coded and administered now by me, part-time, while I do
 other stuff (like run the business).. I doubt it could be produced by
 any other tool, at least not without way more support staff and
 equipment.

 -Justin
