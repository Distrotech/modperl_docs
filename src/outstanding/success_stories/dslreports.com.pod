  http://dslreports.com pages are entirely modperl, I do almost a
  million pageviews per day, and each page is from 20 to 200 sql
  statements.. and entirely produced by modperl, not templates or
  anything. most pages are produced in less than 200ms.. all the 150
  internal forums as well (10000 posted messages per day and over 2
  million messages online and searchable) are modperl. Everything is
  modperl :)
  
  I use two modperl servers, one sql server, and one frontend (mod
  proxy) server.. all of them are dual cpu 500-1mhz cpus and from 1-4gig
  of memory..
  
  This is all coded and administered now by me, part-time, while I do
  other stuff (like run the business).. I doubt it could be produced by
  any other tool, at least not without way more support staff and
  equipment.
  
  regards
