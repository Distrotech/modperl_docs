We just completed a website for Lind-Waldock & Co.
(http://www.lind-waldock.com/), the world's largest discount commodities
trading firm. The site is to be used by their customers (>30,000) for
live and delayed quotes, dynamic charts, and news pertaining to the
futures industry, as well as access to their online order entry
system. The site will take quite a beating once all of their customers
transition to it from Lind's previous Windows application--plenty of live and
delayed data is auto-refreshed.

Scenario: Client needed to develop a website that could authenticate
off their existing customer database, and many links needed to be
dynamically generated to reflect the level of service that the
customer subscribed to (this info also kept in the database). The
customer area had to be SSL enabled, fast, and support a slew of Perl
scripts that the quote vendor had already written. And of course, they
needed the whole thing yesterday.

They already had Netscape Enterprise Server and we investigated some NSAPI
solutions but were terribly disappointed with what Netscape had to
offer. We did some tests and decided to run with Stronghold and
mod_perl. We wrote less than 10 lines of code to get the site
authenticating off the database using Apache_DBI and just a few more
to handle the dynamic URL generation.

We began analysis on Dec 1, and delivered the completed site on Mar
4--with 2 weeks off for Christmas, no less! Two days after release,
the site is averaging about 3 requests a second--and that is certain
to grow exponentially as more customers make the switch from the old
Windows application.

More importantly, mod_perl allowed us to work the webserver and code
around our design--not the other way around.
