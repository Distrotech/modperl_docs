  Find Job! http://www.find-job.net is the biggest computer and
  Internet related employment site in Japan, and it is running on
  mod_perl completely. We have around 75,000 registered users and 10,000
  registered companies. Our pageviews are around 4 million per month. Our
  whole system was running under plain CGI written in Perl, until
  recently we changed it to mod_perl ModPerl::PerlRun with
  HTML::Template templating system. On some scripts we saw up to 400% of
  speed improvement, and total CPU load average went down around
  50%. The change from mod_cgi to mod_perl ModPerl::PerlRun itself was
  painless at all.
  
  Right now we are working on our scripts, to make it mod_perl
  ModPerl::Registry compatible. We are going to run our site on mod_perl
  ModPerl::Registry once it is finished, and hope to see some more speed
  improvement.
