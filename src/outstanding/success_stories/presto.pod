 At the risk of this becoming a giant mod_perl lovefest, I'll second that.
 I've learned more about perl & apache in my dozen months or so of mod_perl
 than in my many years of work with apache & perl.  mod_perl has definately
 forced me to improve the quality of my perl coding manyfold & taught me more
 than I ever thought I wanted to know about Apache.
