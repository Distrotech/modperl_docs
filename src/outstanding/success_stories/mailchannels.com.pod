  We have been using mod_perl successfully for several months now as a
  flexible email proxy -- we just wrapped Net::Server::Mail and with a
  few additional hacks and it worked. Matt Sergeant did the same thing
  with qpsmtpd and I have heard that the performance results were
  initially very promising
  (http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/qmail0411/120/1/1/1.html).
  
  More details of our hack (patches etc.) are at
  http://www.mailchannels.com/opensource and
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-SMTP/lib/Apache/SMTP.pm.
  
  IMHO, using mod_perl as a general application server is a great
  idea. For us there really was no other viable alternative. We looked
  at POE, Sendmail's milter API, Net::Server and of course qpsmtpd but
  the reliability, portability, and scalability of Apache was what
  caused us to go through the effort of making our bits work on
  mod_perl.
  
  To configure a mail server, it's just a matter of adding a VirtualHost
  section to the Apache configuration et voila. And as packages such as
  mod_throttle move over to Apache 2, we will gain the wonderment of a
  solid resource management tool for mail traffic. Joy!

  Ken
