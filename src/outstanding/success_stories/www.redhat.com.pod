  Red Hat's main website, www.redhat.com, is a mod_perl site (mainly
  Apache::ASP).  Also, the Red Hat Network's website, rhn.redhat.com, is
  pure mod_perl, using a custom templating system (which I'll release
  one day, as soon as I find time..).  It's actually a fairly
  complicated use of mod_perl for a web application, totalling around
  60k likes of perl.
