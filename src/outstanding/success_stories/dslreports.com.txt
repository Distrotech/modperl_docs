Subject: dslreports.com: million pageviews per day
URL: http://dslreports.com
Traffic: a million pageviews per day

http://dslreports.com pages are entirely modperl, I do almost a
million pageviews per day, and each page is from 20 to 200 sql
statements.. and entirely produced by modperl, not templates or
anything. most pages are produced in less than 200ms.. all the 150
internal forums as well (10000 posted messages per day and over 2
million messages online and searchable) are modperl. Everything is
modperl :)

I use two modperl servers, one sql server, and one frontend (mod
proxy) server.. all of them are dual cpu 500-1mhz cpus and from 1-4gig
of memory..

This is all coded and administered now by me, part-time, while I do
other stuff (like run the business).. I doubt it could be produced by
any other tool, at least not without way more support staff and
equipment.
