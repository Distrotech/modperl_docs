  http://m4m4sex.com/ is a gay personals system that targets local gay
  communities in a number of cities. The site is written exclusively in
  mod_perl and uses mysql as a backend. The only purpose of the site is
  to ensure that people find sex partners as efficiently as possible.
  
  I'm impressed with how well mod_perl and mysql have held up under
  considerable load as more cities were added and as more users joined.
  It also continued to please as we re-worked the site to allow users to
  switch between languages (4 at this point) on-the-fly.
  
  It all happens on vanilla x86 hardware. Everything from user signups,
  account maintenance, online chat, secure payment options, renewing
  subscriptions, reports, etc.
  
  Hooray for mod_perl!
