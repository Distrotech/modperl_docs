Subject: modperl usage in financial institutions
URL: http://www.inteligo.pl

I am more than happy being now able to add the new nice
reference. Please, patch my English where necessary...

Polish internet bank named Inteligo (http://www.inteligo.pl) recently
migrated its transactional web service (the application used by the
bank clients to make different kinds of payment orders, check account
balances etc) from complicated Java-based solution to the modperl
application. The application implements web frontend to the business
services implemented by the main bank system and accessed via the bank
middleware. It is worth mentioning that the application constitute the
main access channel for the bank clients.

After a few days of productional use the application is perceived to
be much faster and lighter than the one previously used.

Two words of warning: 
- inteligo 'informational' website (the pages visible under
  www.inteligo.pl) still use PHP and probably will continue to,
- don't treat this as easy 'perl is faster than Java' claim, there was
  a lot of design and programming work behind the new application...

Being a person who suggested using this technology and worked in a
core development team I can admit that modperl fulfilled myp
erformance expectations and allowed to develop complicated application
fairly quickly.

Thanks to all the people who developed this nice piece of software and
its documentation and to everyone who answered my and my colleagues
questions during the project.
