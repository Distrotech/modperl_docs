mobile.de is one of the biggest online carmarkets in Germany. Its
services are aimed at both professional car dealers and private buyers
and sellers. Under the company's URL - www.mobile.de - individuals can
offer and search for cars free of charge. Professional dealers pay a
fee of EUR 101.24 per month. The fee entitles each dealer to list up
to 250 vehicles in the database.
