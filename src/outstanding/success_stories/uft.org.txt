Subject: Major Teachers Union Launches New Site on mod_perl
URL: http://www.uft.org/

The New York-based United Federation of Teachers, a 150,000-member
teachers union for New York City's teachers in the city's five
boroughs and 1,300 schools, has moved their site from a proprietary
Windows-based system to a new system built on mod_perl and other open
source technologies.

The site uses the (mod_perl-based) Krang content management system
(http://krang.sf.net/) for publishing, enabling a wider range of
people to contribute content with a consistent look-and-feel and a
workflow system to handle the review process.  The new site also
features integration with the union's existing AS/400 systems, and
further integration work is underway to bring more resources on-line
for a wider audience.

My company, Plus Three (http://plusthree.com/) did the technical work
on this project.  Plus Three specializes in helping large non-profit
and political organizations achieve their goals with open source
software.
