Klassno.by is a belarussian auction site, written in mod_perl. It is
designed primarily for the users from Belarus, and takes into account
local specifics. It uses fulltext morphological analysis for indexing
and searching.

In the hope of a brilliant future with tens queries per second and
thousands of active lots, mod_perl was selected as a development
platform in the very beginning. It uses Class::DBI and Template Toolkit,
self-made MVC framework, and is written in OO Perl. It is running Apache
1.3/mod_perl, mysql5 with triggers and views where possible, and nginx
(http://sysoev.ru/nginx) as a frontend http server.
