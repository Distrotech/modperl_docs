Subject: mod_perl 2.0 at the biggest Japanese employment site
URL: http://www.find-job.net
Traffic: 4 million pageviews / month 

Find Job! http://www.find-job.net is the biggest computers and
Internet related employment site in Japan, and it is running on
mod_perl completely. We have around 75000 registered users and 10000
registered companies. Our pageview is around 4 million per month. Our
whole system was running under plain CGI written in Perl, until
recently we changed it to mod_perl ModPerl::PerlRun with
HTML::Template templating system. On some scripts we saw up to 400% of
speed improvement, and total CPU load average went down around
50%. The change from mod_cgi to mod_perl ModPerl::PerlRun itself was
painless at all.

Right now we are working on our scripts, to make it mod_perl
ModPerl::Registry compatible. We are going to run our site on mod_perl
ModPerl::Registry once it is finished, and hope to see some more speed
improvement.
