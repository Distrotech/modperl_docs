bivio.com is a web-delivered application written entirely in perl
which provides complete accounting, tax preparation, automatic
downloads of broker transactions, message boards, file sharing, email
aliases, and more.  Apache/mod_perl on Linux has functioned incredibly
reliably with +99% uptime.

Our declarative MVCF application framework (250 perl classes) is
available under the Artistic License from http://www.bivio.net
This includes a demo application http://petshop.bivio.net which
is a more concise implementation of J2EE's Blueprint Architecture.
