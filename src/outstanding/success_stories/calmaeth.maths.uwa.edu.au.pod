  At the Mathematics Department at the University of Western Australia I
  have a web-based computer aided teaching system using mod_perl. The
  students have individual weekly assignments in calculus, statistics,
  linear algebra with diagnostics and assessment built in. The system
  relieves academic staff of the burden of assignment marking and provides
  more personal interaction with students. The system requires database
  management and connection to a computer algebra engine. The transfer from
  a slow/unreliable/Macintosh/Hypercard/Mathematica system to a
  fast/reliable/web system took a couple of months and I had never
  programmed in perl before. The whole excersize was amazingly painless and
  it was entirely mod_perl's doing.
