DateZilla.com is a directory of dating, matchmaking and matrimonials
services and resources. The site is built on mod_perl and HTML::Mason,
with a MySQL database. The speed of mod_perl and MySQL, combined with
the sophisticated caching available in Mason, make the site very fast
despite running on a bargain basement server. The management backend
(content, ad serving, affiliate management, user stats) is also built
on the mod_perl/Mason/MySQL combo, and allows a large site to be
maintained by a small team from the comfort of their laptops.
