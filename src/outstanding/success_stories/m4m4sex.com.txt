Subject: Gay personals system
URL: http://m4m4sex.com

http://m4m4sex.com/ is a gay personals system that targets local gay
communities in a number of cities. The site is written exclusively in
mod_perl and uses mysql as a backend. The only purpose of the site is
to ensure that people find sex partners as efficiently as possible.

I'm impressed with how well mod_perl and mysql have held up under
considerable load as more cities were added and as more users joined.
It also continued to please as we re-worked the site to allow users to
switch between languages (4 at this point) on-the-fly.

It all happens on vanilla x86 hardware. Everything from user signups,
account maintenance, online chat, secure payment options, renewing
subscriptions, reports, etc.

Hooray for mod_perl!
