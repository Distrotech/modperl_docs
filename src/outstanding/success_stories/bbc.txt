We have been running ModPerl to deliver dynamic applications as part of
bbc.co.uk for the past 4 years. At present we have well over 50
applications ( and growing ) using Modperl and based on the
Apache::Registry framework. These include community, message boards,
games, voting, quizzes, searches and listings applications. It serves a
sustained 500 application requests per second using a distributed
architecture.

As we have adopted Apache 2.* on our head-end servers we will next be
looking at how Modperl 2.* can help us in our application layer.
