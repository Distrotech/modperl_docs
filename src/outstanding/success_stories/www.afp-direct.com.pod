  http://www.afp-direct.com hosts the Agence France-Presse's online
  database of news stories and photographs. Agence France-Presse is the
  world's third largest news agency. The online database, available
  through subscription, contains over 6.5 million stories and
  photographs in a full-text searchable database. The web site makes the
  most of mod_perl and its array of modules such as persistent
  connections to back-end servers and custom authentication.
