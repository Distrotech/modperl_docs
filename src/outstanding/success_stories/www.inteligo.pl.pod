  I am more than happy being now able to add the new nice
  reference. Please, patch my English where necessary...
  
  Polish internet bank named Inteligo (http://www.inteligo.pl) recently
  migrated its transactional web service (the application used by the
  bank clients to make different kinds of payment orders, check account
  balances, etc) from a complicated Java-based solution to a modperl
  application. The application implements a web frontend to the business
  services implemented by the main bank system and accessed via the bank
  middleware. It is worth mentioning that the application constitutes the
  main access channel for the bank clients.
  
  After a few days of production use the application is perceived to
  be much faster and lighter than the one previously used.
  
  Two words of warning: 
  - inteligo 'informational' website (the pages visible under
    www.inteligo.pl) still use PHP and probably will continue to,
  - don't treat this as easy 'perl is faster than Java' claim, there was
    a lot of design and programming work behind the new application...
  
  Being a person who suggested using this technology and worked in a
  core development team I can admit that modperl fulfilled my performance 
  expectations and allowed us to develop a complicated application
  fairly quickly.
  
  Thanks to all the people who developed this nice piece of software and
  its documentation and to everyone who answered my and my colleagues
  questions during the project.
