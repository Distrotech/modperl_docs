Singles Heaven - http://singlesheaven.com is a Match Maker site with
34,000+ members and growing. The site is driven by mod_perl, DBI,
Apache::DBI (which provides a persistence to DB connections) and mysql.
The speed is enormous, chatting with mod_perl is a pleasure of experience.
Every page is being generated by about 10 SQL queries, for it does many
dynamic checks every time - like checking for new emails, watching the
users who registered in their watchdog and many more. You don't feel these
queries are actually happen, the speed is of the ``Hello World'' script.

Development path was very short, I have converted plain CGI scripts to run
under mod_perl (Apache::Registry) almost in no time!!! If you are into a
database driven service, give mod_perl a try !!!
