  bivio.com is a web-delivered application written entirely in perl
  which provides complete accounting, tax preparation, automatic
  downloads of broker transactions, message boards, file sharing, email
  aliases, and more.  Apache/mod_perl on Linux has functioned incredibly
  reliably with +99% uptime.

  available under the Artistic License from http://www.bivio.net
  This includes a demo application http://petshop.bivio.net which
  is a more concise implementation of J2EE's Blueprint Architecture.
