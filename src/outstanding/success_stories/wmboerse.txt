Subject: Large real-time stock exchange game
URL: http://www.wmboerse.de

Hello,

another mod_perl success story:

Have a look at www.wmboerse.de - it's a german real-time 
stock exchange simulation game for the soccer world championship.
Participation is free and there are some nice prices to be won.

The technology used is Apache, mod_perl, DBI and DB::Adabas. The
project is sponsored by Sun Microsystems (they are supplying
a Sun Ultra Enterprise 450 with 3 CPUs @ 300Mhz and 1GByte RAM at 
the moment), UUNET Germany (bandwidth) and Software AG 
(Adabas-D database).

The server is a real beast. It's amazingly fast. The game is running
since Sunday. At the moment, there are 2344 players, 183 of them
have been active in the last 10 minutes. We are expecting a large
increase in players as soon as national television reports about
the game.

The load is at 0.80, there are 123 processes, still 400MB RAM free
(we plugged in 512 MB today, previously the box had 512MB).
We will increase the maximum number of child processes if we get 
close to the current limit (100).

Here's some data from the Apache status page:
Server uptime: 4 hours 10 minutes 58 seconds
Total accesses: 254671 - Total Traffic: 902.9 MB (!)
CPU Usage: u27.68 s10.98 cu2.03 cs.63 - .274% CPU load
16.9 requests/sec - 61.4 kB/second - 3717 B/request
18 requests currently being processed, 14 idle servers 

Anyway, grab a browser and have a look. The project is a great success
so far, and it couldn't have been done this easily and quickly without 
mod_perl and the other great free software out there.

Thanks and enjoy!
