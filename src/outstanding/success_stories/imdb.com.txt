We use mod_perl for just about everything and then some too; serving
around 1.25 million pageviews per day. All database lookups are handled
inside Apache via mod_perl. Each request also goes through several
mod_perl handlers and is then reformated on the fly with mod_perl SSI
to embed advertising banners and give different views of the site depending
on the hostname used.

The Internet Movie Database (as we all know, a mod_perl driven site) won a
1997 Webby as the best Film site on the web.
