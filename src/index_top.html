"mod_perl is more than CGI scripting on steroids.  It is a whole new way to 
create dynamic content by utilizing the full power of the Apache web server 
to create stateful sessions, customized user authentication systems, smart 
proxies and much more.  Yet, magically, your old CGI scripts will continue 
to work and work very fast indeed.  With mod_perl you give up nothing and 
 gain so much!"

<p>mod_perl brings together the full power of the <a
href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> programming language and the <A
href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> HTTP server.  You can use
Perl to <b>manage Apache</b>, <b>respond to requests for web
pages</b> and much more.</p>

<p>mod_perl gives you a persistent Perl interpreter embedded in your web
server.  This lets you avoid the overhead of starting an external
interpreter and avoids the penalty of Perl start-up time, giving you
<b>super-fast dynamic content</b>.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from the Perl community, there are <b>hundreds of
modules</b> written with mod_perl, for everything from <b>persistent
database connections</b>, to <b>templating sytems</b>, to complete
<b>XML content delivery systems</b>.  Web sites like <b><A
href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a></b> and <b><A
href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired Magazine</a></b> use mod_perl.
<b>Shouldn't you?</b></p>
