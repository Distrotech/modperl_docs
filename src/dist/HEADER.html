<b>URL regular expression DoS (CVE-2007-1349)</b><br>
A flaw was discovered in the Apache::PerlRun module shipped with
mod_perl 1.29 and earlier and in the ModPerl::RegistryCooker module shipped with
mod_perl 2.03 and earlier.  A remote attacker could craft a URL with a path that
would be interpreted as a regular expression, potentially allowing a
denial of service by creating an expression that will take a very long
time to run.  This vulnerability only affects Apache::PerlRun and
custom subclasses of ModPerl::RegistryCooker that explicitly use the
namespace_from_uri() method.  The Apache::Registry, ModPerl::PerlRun,
and ModPerl::Registry modules are NOT affected.
</p>
<p>
Users of mod_perl 1.29 and earlier are encouraged to upgrade to 1.30 if
they use Apache::PerlRun for their applications.  Users of mod_perl 2.03
are encouraged to check their custom code for calls to the
namespace_from_uri() method and replace it with the
namespace_from_filename() method.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please note!</b><br>
mod_perl-1.24_01.tar.gz or later is required for Apache >= 1.3.14.
