channel.

=head1 The IRC Channel

Although there is nothing "official" about it, mod_perl people usually
hang out on the I<irc.perl.org> or I<irc.rhizomatic.net> IRC servers
(on port 6667), in the channel I<#modperl>.

You might also want to check in at the I<#axkit-dahut> channel where
many mod_perl people hang out for non-serious talk, and the I<#axkit>
channel for AxKit related talk. See http://axkit.org/irclog.xml for
more info.
