perl.apache.org Site Help

=head1 Description

This document helps to solve problems you may encounter while using
perl.apache.org.

=head1 FAQ

Please read this FAQ first.

=head2 Q. The site looks very bad/unusable in the browser that I use.

B<A>. The site was developed using the open standards: HTML
4.01 and CSS 2.0. Any browser that follows these two standards
shouldn't have a problem to properly render this site. If you are
using some very old browser, you should upgrade it.

Text-only browsers are definitely supported.

If you are using a latest stable browser and you still have a problem,
please L<contact the docs-dev mailing list|/"Contact_Info">. Please
post to the list a snapshot of the what seems to be looking bad and/or
unusable along with the name and version of the browser and the
platform you are running it on. Preferably upload the snapshot
somewhere and post the URL to the location of the shapshot, especially
if the snapshot is of a big size.

=head2 Q. I cannot read the PDF version of the documents

B<A>. The PDF files require a browser plugin or standalone PDF reader
to be read: You can get the Adobe Acrobat Reader for many different
platforms from their website:
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html .

=head2 Q. How the site search works

B<A>. The search page reachable from the menu includes a complete
usage documentation. But here is a short description:

In the menu on the left there is a search widget which can search the
current subset of documents, or the whole site. For example if you are
reading one of the documents in the mod_perl developers guide the
search will return hits within this document subset. If you are
searching at the root of all documentation, all documentation subsets
will be searched. And finally if you search at the root of the site,
the whole site will be searched. This widget is not intended to
replace the I<Find in the current document> feature implemented in
most web browsers.

The L<dedicated search page|XXX> provides a more flexible search
options, including the explanation of these options.


=head2 Q. The pages take too long to download!

B<A>. Yes, we have a lot of documentation. That is definitely a good
thing. But, for example, the guide alone takes 735 pages in PDF
format, so you might be overwhelmed by the size of the files if you're
downloading them each time from the net. In that case, we suggest that
you L<download|/How_this_site_was_created> the sources, build the
documentaion and read it off your hard disk.

Another idea to make it load faster is to adjust your browser's
caching. By caching the pages, you might not have to download them
each time.


=head2 Q. Why isn't your site running mod_perl?

B<A>. 99% of this site is comprised of a static content, so it doesn't
make sense to run mod_perl to serve it. You can see mod_perl in action
L<here|outstanding::index>.

=head1 Contact Info

If you've read the L<FAQ|/"FAQ"> and you still have a problem, please
email L<docs-dev (at) perl.apache.org|maillist::list-docs-dev> and supply as
much information as possible to help us solve your problem.

=head1 How this site was created

The site is automatically generated from a collection of HTML and POD
files, using Perl DocSet Framework, which in turn is based on Template
Toolkit.

If you are interested in downloading the site sources, you can get them from CVS:

  % cvs -d ":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic" login

password: "anoncvs".

  % cvs -d ":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic" co modperl-docs

META: add the URL of the DocSet when it gets released.
