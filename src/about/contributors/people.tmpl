mod_perl along the way, and information about them">
</head>

<body>

<p> There are thousands of people who have contributed to what
mod_perl is today.  This file is here to recognize the tremendous
efforts of the major contributors to the mod_perl effort. </p>

<p> While <a href="#doug-maceachern">Doug MacEachern</a> is behind the
majority of mod_perl's design, code and documentation, he and mod_perl
never would have made it this far without the help from everyone in
the mod_perl community.  His heartfelt thanks goes out to all of you!
</p>

<p> This list is generated from a set of text files, and the
contributors are sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p>Module authors aren't listed here, because keeping track of them
would be too much work. For information about module authors, please
refer to the <a href="../../products/apache-modules.html">Apache/Perl
Module list</a>.</p>
