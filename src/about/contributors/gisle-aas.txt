Summary: Original author of mod_perl. API enhancements/docs.

Gisle wrote an early "proof-of-concept" <i>mod_perl.c</i> and
<i>perl_glue.xs</i> on March 25, 1996 to be exact.  While next to none
of that code is present in the current mod_perl source, as the
embedded model and XS &lt;-&gt; Apache API interface were changed, it
was an important inspirational kick start to what mod_perl has become
today.

Gisle has also contributed to mod_perl's <tt>Apache::Constants</tt>
module, along with API enhancements and documentation.
