Summary: Method handlers, API, AIX fixes and Apache::AuthCookie.

Eric had a big hand in implementing and testing method handlers.  He
also contributed to some of the Apache/Perl API, along with making
sense of some AIX mysteries for us.  And, his
<tt>Apache::AuthCookie</tt> module is an inspiration to us all.
