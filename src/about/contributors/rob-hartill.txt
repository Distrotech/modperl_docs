Summary: Second to run mod_perl in production. Testing.

Rob was the second to run mod_perl in a production enviroment, and
perhaps the best known mod_perl site, the <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie DataBase</a>.  He's also
provided various bug fixes, enhancements and mail list support since
the early days of mod_perl.  Always one step ahead testing mod_perl
against Apache cvs snapshots.  It was Rob's kicking that made the
mod_perl CVS tree come to be.
