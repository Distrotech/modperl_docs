Torsten came to know mod_perl in 1998. For a few years he has used it simply
as a tool. His first contribution came in just on the eve of mod_perl 2.0
in 2004. Since then he has fixed many bugs and continues to help users on
the mailing list. He also wrote a few
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~opi/">CPAN</a> modules around mod_perl(2).
Every once in a while Torsten publishs interesting solutions and work-arounds
on <a href="http://foertsch.name/ModPerl-Tricks/">his site</a>.

Torsten works as a freelance programmer. In fact, he can be hired to provide
professional mod_perl support. Although most of his clients are German
companies he offers his knowledge worldwide. Torsten's experience
in C-programming spans back to the year 1989, his Perl-experience to 1998.
He works almost exclusively on Linux.

In his free time Torsten likes to solve Sudoku. He finds this passion
involves very much the same skills as debugging programs.
