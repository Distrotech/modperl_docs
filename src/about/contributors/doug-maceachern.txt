Summary: Everything :)

Doug is, as everybody knows, mod_perl's dictator for life. It's his
great efforts and skills that made mod_perl what it is today, and he
is continuing along that line with great motivation. He is currently
employed by <a href="http://www.covalent.net/">Covalent
Technologies</a> to work on mod_perl full-time.

Doug has written most of the code and a solid part of the
documentation for mod_perl, and has also co-authored <a
href="http://www.modperl.com/">Writing Apache modules with Perl and
C</a> with Lincoln Stein.
