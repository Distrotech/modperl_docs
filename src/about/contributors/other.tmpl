=head1 NAME

Other contributors to mod_perl

=head1 Description

The other contributions made to mod_perl, that we don't have enough
information on.

There are B<many> other people who have contributed a great deal to
mod_perl in one way or another, this list is derived from the Changes
file, activity on the L<mod_perl list|maillist::modperl> including
support, suggestions and new ideas, along with help through private
mails or other means.

This list is most likely incomplete.  My apologies if that is the
case, please send me an email if you have been left out and your
contribution will be recognized!

If you do not feel you've made a contribution, remember that L<your
help is always welcome|contribute::index> and appreciated.  You should
consider yourself a contributor to the mod_perl effort even if you are
simply using mod_perl!

=head1 The Apache and Perl communities

If there was no Apache, there would be no mod_perl. See the Apache
contributors list at http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/.

If there was no Perl, there would be no mod_perl. Perl authors are
credited in the distribution's I<AUTHORS> file.

We owe a great deal of thanks to The Apache Group, Larry Wall and the
perl5-porters, along with the communities that support them both.

=head1 Contributors

The contributors that are listed here only come by name, as we don't
have enough information about them. These people have mostly submitted
small patches to the code or to documentation, which have been very
appreciated by the community. Some others have helped through the
mailing lists, supporting users.
