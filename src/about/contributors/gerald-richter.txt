Summary: Embperl, mod_perl 2.0 build system abstraction.

Gerald has helped us with various bug spotting and fixing over the
years.  His <a
href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/"><tt>Embperl</tt></a> toolkit,
specially designed to run under mod_perl, has saved many lives.

He is now working on abstracting the mod_perl 2.0 build system.
