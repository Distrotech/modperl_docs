<meta name="description" content="A list of people having helped
mod_perl along the way, and information about them">
</head>

<body>

<p> There are thousands of people who have contributed to what
mod_perl is today.  This file is here to recognize the tremendous
efforts of the major contributors to the mod_perl effort. </p>

<p> While <a href="#doug-maceachern">Doug MacEachern</a> is behind the
majority of mod_perl's design, code and documentation, he and mod_perl
never would have made it this far without the help from everyone in
the mod_perl community.  His heartfelt thanks goes out to all of you!
</p>

<p> This list is generated from a set of text files, and the
contributors are sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p>Module authors aren't listed here, because keeping track of them
would be too much work. For information about module authors, please
refer to the <a href="../../products/apache-modlist.html">Apache/Perl
Module list</a>.</p>

was an important insipirational kick start to what mod_perl has become
today.

<p>Everybody knows Lincoln gave us the must-have <code>CGI.pm</code>
module; he's put forth considerable effort into porting and optimizing
it for mod_perl.  Lincoln also wrote the original
<code>Apache::Request</code> module, a <code>CGI.pm</code>-like module
on top of the Apache API.

</p>
<p>As an addition to his great programming efforts, Lincoln has
contributed his writing skills by co-authoring <a

C</a>, which has for a long time been the ultimate reference to
mod_perl programming.

<b>Name: </b> Stas Bekman<br>

<b>E-mail: </b> stas (at) stason.org<br>


<b>URL: </b> <a href="http://www.stason.org/">http://www.stason.org/</a><br>




</p>

<p>Stas has started contributing to mod_perl in 1998 by creating the mini
mod_perl guide, simply to reduce the rate of broken record questions
on the mod_perl list. After a few years, some people still referred to
the guide as mini, while it contained more than 600 pages at that
time. As of today more than 200 users and developers helped Stas to
write, review, improve and polish the guide.

</p>
<p>While not working on the documentation, at the remaining spare time,
Stas has written a few Apache modules available from <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=Stas+Bekman">his
CPAN directory</a> and did some work on mod_perl 1.0 series.

</p>
<p>In autumn 2001 <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">Ticket Master</a>
has kindly sponsored Stas for one year to help with mod_perl. Stas
used this time to help with the development of mod_perl 2.0, to lead
the creation of the new perl.apache.org site, to advocate mod_perl via
articles in popular online zines and conferences, to help with the
mod_perl list and as usual to write a lot of documentation, mainly for
mod_perl 2.0.

</p>
<p>He is also co-authoring <a href="http://modperlbook.org/">Practical
mod_perl</a> with Eric Cholet, to be published soon by O'Reilly and
Associates.

</p>
<p>And of course, since 1998, when Stas discovered for himself mod_perl,
he was finding ways to use it at work, even while doing x86 hardware
development and verification at Intel. He is now thinking about
mod_perl 3.0's architecture, hopefully to be implemented solely with
AND and OR gates, driven by the Perl 6.0 chipset for the best
performance. Don't be surprised when you get offered a shiny Bluetooth
mod_perl 3.0 PCI card when you shop for your new server machine.
