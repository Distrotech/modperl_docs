Summary: mod_perl digest, various modules.

James took over the maintainership of the mod_perl mailing list digest
after Geoffrey Young didn't have enough time anymore, and is now
trying to send it off to the mailing list as often as he can.

He has also contributed a number of modules to the CPAN, such as
<code>Apache::Handlers</code>, <code>Module::Use</code>, and <a
href="http://uttu.tamu.edu/">Uttu</a>, a web application framework.
