Summary: Documentation, modules, mod_perl 2.0 contributions, book, articles

Stas has started contributing to mod_perl in 1998 by creating the mini
mod_perl guide, simply to reduce the rate of broken record questions
on the mod_perl list. After a few years, some people still referred to
the guide as mini, while it contained more than 600 pages at that
time. As of today more than 200 users and developers helped Stas to
write, review, improve and polish the guide.

While not working on the documentation, at the remaining spare time,
Stas has written a few Apache modules available from <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=Stas+Bekman">his
CPAN directory</a> and did some work on mod_perl 1.0 series.

In autumn 2001 <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">Ticket Master</a>
has kindly sponsored Stas for one year to help with mod_perl. Stas
used this time to help with the development of mod_perl 2.0, to lead
the creation of the new perl.apache.org site, to advocate mod_perl via
articles in popular online zines and conferences, to help with the
mod_perl list and as usual to write a lot of documentation, mainly for
mod_perl 2.0.

He is also co-authoring <a href="http://modperlbook.org/">Practical
mod_perl</a> with Eric Cholet, to be published soon by O'Reilly and
Associates.

And of course, since 1998, when Stas discovered for himself mod_perl,
he was finding ways to use it at work, even while doing x86 hardware
development and verification at Intel. He is now thinking about
mod_perl 3.0's architecture, hopefully to be implemented solely with
AND and OR gates, driven by the Perl 6.0 chipset for the best
performance. Don't be surprised when you get offered a shiny Bluetooth
mod_perl 3.0 PCI card when you shop for your new server machine.
