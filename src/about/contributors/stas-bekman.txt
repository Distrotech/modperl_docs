Summary: Lots of documentation, modules, mod_perl 2. Co-authoring Practical mod_perl.

Stas's work on the mod_perl Guide (now integrated into the
documentation) gave birth to a <i>great</i> piece of documentation,
recommended to all aspiring mod_perl programmers.  He has also
contributed a great deal to the mod_perl documentation and was the
project leader for the creation of this site.

On the coding side, Stas has written the
<code>Apache::VMonitor</code>, <code>Apache::GTopLimit</code> and
<code>Apache::Watchdog::RunAway</code> modules. He has contributed a
great deal of work to mod_perl 1.x, and is now also working on
mod_perl 2, most notably the <code>ModPerl::Registry</code> family.


He is also co-authoring <a href="http://modperlbook.org/">Practical
mod_perl</a> with Eric Cholet, to be published soon by O'Reilly.
