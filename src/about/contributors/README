These files make up the list of contributors to mod_perl.

Generation is done by running

  % perl make.pl

in this directory. Commit any generated files to CVS.

*.txt:
  These files, with a name related to the name (usually, ($name =
  lc($name)) =~ s/\s+/-/) of the contributor, give all the info.

  headers (case-sensitive):
  Name required
  Email will be antispammed and listed after Name
  URL will be hyperlinked

  Image will be inserted on the right hand side. Dimensions should be
  width of 72 max, probably in JPG format. Its value is the relative
  file name.

  The others are free form, except no spaces in the key.

  The body may contain HTML. Each paragraph is surrounded with <p>
  tags, so you don't have to worry about that.

people.tmpl

  The template file for the main list (with info). Receives a list of
  persons in the "people" var. See existing one for more details.

people.html

  The generated list of contributors.

other.list

  Contains list of other contributors (by name). Contributors are
  separated by newline. Just add them where you want, they will be
  sorted when generated. Don't forget a newline at EOF or there might
  be trouble with the POD.

other.tmpl

  The template for the "other" list. Receives list of names in the
  "people" variable. Generates POD.

other.pod

  Generated list of minor contributors.

make.pl
  The program that ties everything together. Just run from this directory as 
    % perl make.pl
  It will generate people.html and other.pod. Make sure you run this
  *and* commit the generated files to CVS, because people shouldn't
  have to run make.pl when generating the site locally.
