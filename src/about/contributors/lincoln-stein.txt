Summary: CGI.pm, Apache::Request. Co-authored the Eagle book.

Everybody knows Lincoln gave us the must-have <code>CGI.pm</code>
module; he's put forth considerable effort into porting and optimizing
it for mod_perl.  Lincoln also wrote the original
<code>Apache::Request</code> module, a <code>CGI.pm</code>-like module
on top of the Apache API.

As an addition to his great programming efforts, Lincoln has
contributed his writing skills by co-authoring <a
href="http://www.modperl.com/">Writing Apache Modules with Perl and
C</a>, which has for a long time been the ultimate reference to
mod_perl programming.
