Summary: mod_perl 2.0 contributions, mod_perl 1.0 maintainer, modules

Philippe has started working on the mod_perl project in 1998, writing
some Apache::* modules on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gozer/">CPAN</a>
and eventually started helping out with mod_perl 1.0 &amp; 2.0 development.

In 2005, he joined the ranks of <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com">ActiveState</a>'s
Perl Cult.  He now spends a lot more time dealing with Perl itself instead of working
on high-traffic websites for <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">TicketMaster</a>. 
Instead, he is now often busy building and debugging Perl things, including Perl,
mod_perl and all of CPAN (yes, all of it, regularly) on a large variety of platforms.

Philippe is also the current maintainer of mod_perl 1.0.
