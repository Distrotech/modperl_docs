Summary: mod_perl 2.0 contributions, mod_perl 1.0 maintainer, modules

Philippe has started working on the mod_perl project in 1998, writing
some Apache::* modules on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gozer/">CPAN</a>
and eventually started helping out with mod_perl 1.0 &amp; 2.0 development.

In the summer of 2003, he was hired by <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">Ticket Master</a>
to join their existing mod_perl development team.  Some of his time is dedicated to helping out
in dealing with bugs in mod_perl 1.0 and in moving mod_perl 2.0 forward. He gets to see first-hand
how mod_perl scales to insanely high-traffic websites, while looking for ways to improve it even
further.

Philippe is also the current maintainer of mod_perl 1.0.
