These logos are the "official" ones, derived from the official logo,
by Michael Demers (mike (at) inteo.com).

The SVG files were created by Matt Sergeant matt (at)
sergeant.org. One of them has an animated cogs effect, which is pretty
neat.

To create an animated banner, I used the ImageMagick perl
library. Included code is in animate.pl. Just run it as:

  % perl animate.pl

(disregard any errors, I usually get some warning about missing
delegate files etc, but it works anyhow).

It uses banner1.png, banner2.png, banner3.png, and mp_banner.png to
create banner_animated.gif as an animated gif. You may edit those
files, or add new ones, but make sure to keep them all at 468x60px.

Make sure to not name anything banner.* verbatim. It gave problems on
my ad-removing proxy. I guess these are ads anyway, so it doesn't
matter that much, but the other names weren't a problem. That's why
it's mp_banner.png and not banner.png.

GIF versions are supposed to be the "official" ones, because PNG still
crashes old browsers. PNG versions should still be supplied as
"source" versions and for the people wanting to use them.

Thanks to Jonathan M. Hollin for running the button/logo contest, if
it wasn't for him we wouldn't have all these graphics!
