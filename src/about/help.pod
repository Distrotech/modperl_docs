perl.apache.org.

=head1 FAQ

Please read this FAQ first.

=head2 Q. The site looks very bad/unusable in the browser that I use.

A. The site was developed using the open source standards: HTML 4.01
and CSS 2.0. Any browser that follows the standards shouldn't have a
problem to properly render this site. If you are using some very old
browser, you should upgrade it. And you definitely don't want to use
Netscape 4x.

Text-only browsers are definitely supported.

If you are using a latest stable browser and you still have a problem,
please L<contact the docs-dev mailing list|/"Contact_Info">. Please
post to the list a snapshot of the what seems to be looking bad and/or
unusable along with the name and version of the browser and the
platform you are running it on. Preferably upload the snapshot
somewhere and post the URL to the location of the shapshot, especially
if the snapshot is of a big size.

=head2 Q. I cannot read the PDF and source version of the documents

In order to save bandwidth and make the downloads faster, all PDF and
source versions of the documents are compressed with gzip and have a
I<.gz> extension.

If you choose to download the file, beware that some browsers strip
the I<.gz> extension while saving the file, without uncompressing the
file. Others uncompress the file, but forget to remove the I<.gz>
extension. So depending on which of the buggy behaviors your browser
implements, you either need to add the I<.gz> extension and uncompress
the file using C<gzip(1)> or equivalent utility, or if the file was
already uncompressed, you should simply remove the I<.gz> extension.

If you choose to directly open the file in the application without
first opening it, beware that some browser will invoke the application
without first uncompressing the file. In this case you must download
the file first, uncompress it and only then open it with the
application.

Toolkit.
