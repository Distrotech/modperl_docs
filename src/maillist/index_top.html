The most popular list for sharing ideas is the <a
href="modperl.html">mod_perl users list</a>. If you have any
questions about mod_perl, that is where you should go. The other lists
cover more specific subjects, mostly related to mod_perl development.

<p>
Please read the <a href="email-etiquette.html">mod_perl mailing list
guidelines</a> before posting, as these are important to keeping
discussion organized on the list.

<p>
If you have questions not directly related to mod_perl, you should check
out the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">Perl mailing lists</a> and the <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/lists.html">Apache mailing
lists</a>, which will probably be of more help. Or look among the list of
<a href="../docs/offsite/other.html">Other Topics</a>, as there might be a
pointer to a place where you can get your question answered.
