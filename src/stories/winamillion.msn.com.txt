The Microsoft Network promotion running to increase subscribership
located at http://winamillion.msn.com/ is run on mod_perl.  The
contest ends at the end of the month, so check it out before then ;-)

Anyhow, the system is currently pounding nearly 10 million hits per
week to the web pages, of which about 1 million go through mod_perl.
Each of those accesses runs through on averate 3 SQL queries to a
MySQL database and 2 references to DB_File databases.

There is no way in heck it would have run without mod_perl.  By the
way, this is using Squid in accelerator mode, as I described in the
tuning docs.  Squid handles about 93% of the content (the static and
mostly static stuff).
