  <STRONG>Singles Heaven</STRONG> - http://singlesheaven.com is a
  <STRONG>Match Maker</STRONG> site with 34,000+ members and
  growing. The site is driven by mod_perl, DBI, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE>
  (which provides a persistence to DB connections) and mysql. The speed
  is enormous, chatting with mod_perl is a pleasure of experience.
  Every page is being generated by about 10 SQL queries, for it does
  many dynamic checks every time - like checking for new emails,
  watching the users who registered in their watchdog and many more. You
  don't feel these queries are actually happen, the speed is of the
  ``Hello World'' script.
  
  Development path was very short, I have converted plain CGI scripts to
  run under mod_perl (Apache::Registry) almost in no time!!! If you are
  into a database driven service, give mod_perl a try !!!
