  iAgora was started in mid-1998, as a community site for
  internationally minded people.  After investigating the major
  existing web development systems, we chose to go with Linux, Apache
  and mod_perl.  Three years later, we're very happy with this choice.  
  
  At iAgora we are constantly adding features and sections to our
  site, and refining the ones we have.  For us it was very important
  to have a flexible platform, that would give us complete freedom in
  organizing our code, and customizing how the pages are generated.
  
  We have found the combination of Linux, Apache and mod_perl to be:
  
  * cost-effective
  
  There are no software licences to pay, the programs are easy enough
  to install and configure, and many free support and middleware
  modules can be obtained from CPAN.  
  
  * stable
  
  The running servers have had very few crashes, and generally not
  needed much maintenance.  We have also found it very useful to be
  able to administer the servers remotely.
  
  * flexible
  
  Since mod_perl lets perl access low-level hooks within Apache, it is
  possible to have complete control over any aspect of its operation.
  
  For instance, we found it easy and convenient to create virtual
  URLs, where some path elements were matched to database queries
  rather than directories on disk, while still basically serving an
  HTML file.
  
  * adapted for large site creation
  
  Mod_perl gives us complete control over how HTML and perl code
  interface to each other.  By using a templating to the fullest
  extent, we minimize the amount of duplication both in HTML and perl.
  This also lets us have common navigation and design accross the
  whole site, while separately maintaining the various form-based
  applications that make the site.
