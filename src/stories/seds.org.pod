  I run a web site for approximately 1200 students of introductory astronomy
  here at the U of Arizona. The server is an old Sun Sparc 1 and we use
  lots of perl CGI's to connect to a database on the backend and create
  custom pages. Before mod_perl, the site was unacceptable slow. Now, with
  the scripts re-written to use mod_perl, the dynamically created pages load
  faster than regular HTML files.
