You may not want to touch this one, but adultad.com contracted me to fix
their adult banner exchange to where it could throw more than 1.5
banners a second.  I put it under mod_perl, and it now tops out at
slightly over 20 banners per second.  It is now throwing approximately
10 Million banners a week solid without a problem.  The banner exchange
(both banner throwing/logging and click-thru redirection/logging) is
running 100% under mod_perl.
