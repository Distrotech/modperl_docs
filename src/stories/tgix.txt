I have 2 success stories to share:

1. I'm finishing a web-based mod_perl/javascript (client side) contact
management system with heavy Apache::DBI and Registry use. This system
is for a "fortune-500 pharmaceudical (sp?) giant". It is replacing an
unmanageable (their description) Lotus Domino application.

2. It production, a mod_perl server for gathering web traffic statistics
for an up and coming web traffic reporting company. The mod_perl
enhanced server gathers data from thousands of client and server based
proxies around the world. Data is stored in Oracle using Apache::DBI.
This replaced a poorly designed PHP server (poor choice using php in
this scenario imho).
