Site Maintenance

=head1 Description

This document explains how to keep the site clean. 

=head1 Validation Tasks

We start from a site which is absolutely clean. Please keep it that
way.

=over

=item *

Validate internal and external links. For example use: the
I<checklink.pl> from ( http://validator.w3.org/checklink ) I usually
run the check as:

  % checklink.pl --summary --recursive --broken --quiet \
    --html -D 10 http://localhost/modperl-site > report.html

Internal links validation also applies to POD documents. It's easy to
do this, just rebuild the site with the C<-l> argument to
C<bin/build>:

  % bin/build -lf

=item *

Validate the correctness of the documents. The broken HTML can
come from the broken source HTML document or bad templates. One of the
tools that can be used is sgmlcheck. e.g.:

  % sgmlcheck dst_html/index.html

META: anyone knows a better tool that can recursively check the whole
site (ala checklink.pl) and generate an nice report?
