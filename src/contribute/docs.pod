Contribute to the Documentation

=head1 Description

Once you have read the documentation provided for mod_perl, you will
probably have some additions of your own, which are always welcome.

=head1 Submit Corrections

There is a lot of mod_perl documentation. And we are sure it includes
documentation bugs. So if you spot any make sure to report them.

The documentation includes code examples, which sometimes were written
without testing, so it's possible that they are broken. If some
example doesn't work for you, please let us know.

If you notice bad grammar of English and speling, don't hesitate to
tell us where and what you think is the best way to korrectink
it. Da!

=head1 Submit New Articles

If you have some mod_perl knowledge that is not documented please
share it and send us the documentation patch, or a complete new
article. This can include installation and configuration scenarios,
performance improving tips, debugging techniques and what not.

Developers using mod_perl constantly work with other technologies
related to mod_perl. If you have spent some time lurking on the
mod_perl lists, you have probably discovered that mod_perl developers
are pros in many other related fields, such as Apache, Perl,
relational databases, etc. If you think that the mod_perl community
will find an information about a related technology useful, please
submit this information for the inclusion in the documentation.

=head1 How to Send Information and Where

The documentation contributions and corrections are to be sent to the
mod_perl documentation mailing list,
L<docs-dev|maillist::docs-dev>

If the correction is minor, please specify the full URL you are
talking about.

If the correction is medium to large use the svn repository and submit
the patch against the latest version, or even better, just send us the
modified document. L<This document|download::docs> explains how to use
the svn repository.

Note that if you for some reason cannot use the SVN repository, each
page contains a I<src> link in the upper-right corner. From there you
can access the POD/HTML source of documents, which you can then modify
and send to us.
