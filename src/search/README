This document explains how to setup swish-e, index and search the
perl.apache.org site.

Setting up swish-e:
-------------------

- Install the dev version of swish-e.  Currently we use SWISH-E 2.1-dev-25.

- make sure that swish-e is in the PATH, so the apps will be able to
   find it

Indexing:
---------

1. normally build the site:

  % bin/build -f (-d to build pdfs)

which among other things creates the dir: dst_html/search

2. check that swish.conf points to the right base URL, e.g.:

  SwishProgParameters default http://localhost/modperl-site/

3. Index the site

  % cd dst_html/search
  % swish-e -S prog -c swish.conf

You should see something like:

  Indexing Data Source: "External-Program"
  Indexing "./spider.pl"
  ./spider.pl: Reading parameters from 'default'
  
  Summary for: http://localhost/modperl-site/

Now you can search...

Searching:
----------

1. Go to the search page: ..../search/search.html

2. Search

If something doesn't work check the error_log file on the server the
swish.cgi is running on. The most common error is that the swish-e
binary cannot be found by the swish.cgi script. Remember that CGI may
be running under a different username and therefore may not have the
same PATH env variable.


Swish-e related adjustments to the template:
--------------------------------------------

- since we want to index only the real content, we use:
  <!-- Swishcommand index -->,
       only content here will indexed
  <!-- Swishcommand noindex -->,
