Exceptions can be raised in a template using the THROW directive,

    [% THROW user.login 'no user id: please login' %]

or by calling the throw() method on the current Template::Context object,

    $context->throw('user.passwd', 'Incorrect Password');
    $context->throw('Incorrect Password');    # type 'undef'

or from Perl code by calling die() with a Template::Exception object,

    die Template::Exception->new('user.denied', 'Invalid User ID');

or by simply calling die() with an error string.  This is
automagically caught and converted to an  exception of 'undef'
type which can then be handled in the usual way.

    die "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that";
