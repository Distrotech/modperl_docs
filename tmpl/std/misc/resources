and for following and contributing to the development process.  To

The F<tpage> and F<ttree> scripts are distributed and installed along
with the Template Toolkit.  The F<tpage> script simply processes named 
files or STDIN if unspecified, using a default Template object.  The 
F<ttree> script can be used to process entire directory trees of templates,
allowing large content systems such as web sites to be rebuilt from a 
single command or configuration file.

The F<Template::Tutorial> document provides an introduction to the Template
Toolkit and shows some typical examples of usage.
