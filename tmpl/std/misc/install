The latest version of the Template Toolkit can be retrieved from:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Template/

Fetch and install AppConfig 1.52 if you don't already have it installed.
Available from CPAN in:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/Andy_Wardley/

The following modules are optional.  If you have them installed then 
you will be able to access them via the appropriate Template Toolkit 
plugins.  If you don't have them and don't want them, then there's no
need to install them.  They're all available from CPAN if you do.

    Text::Autoformat 1.03+
    DBI 1.14+ (and relevant DBD drivers)
    GD 1.32+
    GD::Text 0.80+
    GD::Graph 1.33+
    GD::Graph3d 0.55+
    Pod::POM 0.1+
    XML::Parser 2.23+
    XML::DOM 1.27+ (in libxml-enno)
    XML::RSS 0.9+ 
    XML::XPath 1.00+

To install the Template Toolkit:

    tar zxf Template-Toolkit-[* tt.version *].tar.gz
    cd Template-Toolkit-[* tt.version *]
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install    

The Makefile.PL will prompt for additional configuration options,
including the installation of optional template libraries, HTML
documentation and examples.  You can safely answer 'n' to all of these
questions for a quick and basic installation.  

If you're running ActivePerl on a Win32 platform then you can use the
Perl Package Manager (PPM) to install the Template Toolkit.  Chris
Winters maintains a repository of pre-compiled PPM packages which contains
the Template Toolkit, AppConfig and others.  For further information, see:
