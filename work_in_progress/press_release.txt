Apache Software Foundation Releases mod_perl 2.0, Bringing Full Apache 2
API to Perl Developers

http://perl.apache.org/, May 23 - The Apache Software Foundation and The
Apache Perl Project are pleased to announce the release of mod_perl
version 2.0. With this release, it is now possible to write Apache 2 web
server modules entirely in Perl, bringing a powerful mix of rapid
development and high-performance to web applications. "We're really
pleased with the amount of new Apache 2 functionality we are able to
provide to perl developers in mod_perl 2," said Geoffrey Young, one of
the leaders of the project.

The mod_perl project brings together the full power of the Perl
programming language and the Apache web server, two of the greatest
success stories in open source software. By exposing the Apache 2 API
from Perl, mod_perl 2 offers a level of access and flexibility not
available in other high-level web development solutions. More than just
an accelerator for CGI scripts, mod_perl is a whole new way to create
dynamic content by utilizing the full power of the Apache web server to
create stateful sessions, customized user authentication systems, smart
proxies and much more.


Prominent new features in mod_perl 2.0 include:


              * I/O Filtering API which allows chaining of different
                content generation tools (PHP, server-side includes) and
                post-processing of dynamic content for compression,
                automatic linking, etc.
                
              * New Apache::Test testing framework for automated testing
                of server modules and applications.
                
              * Extensible high-speed HTTP request parsing library,
                libapreq2, already in use by other Apache 2 modules.
                
              * Easy access to Apache configuration information from
                Perl.
                
              * Configurable multi-threaded operation, vastly improving
                scalability in Microsoft Windows environments.
                
              * Protocol modules can replace the server's core HTTP
                implementation with alternatives like SMTP, FTP, or even
                totally custom protocols, turning Apache 2 into a
                powerful toolkit for building customized server
                applications.
                


E- mail security company MailChannels (http://www.mailchannels.com/) has
been using the new protocol modules feature in mod_perl 2.0 to build
mail proxies in their assured delivery products. “For us, there really
was no other viable alternative,” said Ken Simpson, CEO. MailChannels
chose the mod_perl platform to develop on for “the reliability,
portability, and scalability of Apache.”

This release has received extensive testing, both from automated tests
built with the new Apache::Test framework and from users. The
scalability of mod_perl as a web-development platform is well-
established, with major companies like Ticketmaster
(http://www.ticketmaster.com/) doing billions of dollars of business on
it yearly. Performance compares favorably with PHP and Java solutions in
benchmarks and users routinely report speed improvements of 300% or more
just from porting perl CGI applications to mod_perl. Internet
advertising company WhenU (http://www.whenu.com/) delivers more than
twelve million dynamic pages per day with mod_perl.

Because the project is open source and free to participate in, many
modules compatible with mod_perl 2.0 are already available. In addition,
Perl brings it's famously extensive CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network) to the table, putting libraries for database interaction, XML
manipulation, HTML templating, and everything else developers need to
build modern web sites at their fingertips.
