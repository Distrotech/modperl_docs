This is mod_perl 2.0 docs documentation project repository

The repository is called modperl-docs, but it'll be automatically
placed into modperl-2.0/docs when you check out mod_perl-2.0. So you
can get the repository in one of these ways:

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login

password: anoncvs

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co modperl-2.0

and then look in modperl-2.0/docs or:

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co modperl-docs

You probably want to subscribe to these two mailing lists:

docs-cvs-subscribe@perl.apache.org
docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org

The first one is for cvs commits and the second is for discussions.

Then you can post to the modperl-docs discussion list. To post take
the docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org address and remove the
-subscribe part from it. Please don't advertise the list's direct
address so we won't get spammed. Thanks.

If you are interested in helping us creating great documentation by
reviewing what gets committed and submitting new docs and patches,
please subscribe to these two mailing list.

Welcome to the yet another cool project brought to you by Apache
Software Foundation.
