This is mod_perl 2.0 docs documentation+site project repository

the mod_perl project at the Apache Software Foundation lives here

  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/

and uses the following structure

  modperl/trunk           # equivalent to cvs HEAD - currently
                          # the mod_perl 2.0 development branch

  modperl/tags            # every official mod_perl release

  modperl/docs/trunk      # the mod_perl documentation project

Developers with commit access should use https:// to access
these repositories. See

  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

for svn information in general, and 

  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/apa.html

for a discussion of svn for cvs users (including migration tools):

You probably want to subscribe to these two mailing lists:

docs-cvs-subscribe@perl.apache.org
docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org

The first one is for commits and the second is for discussions.

Then you can post to the modperl-docs discussion list. To post take
the docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org address and remove the
-subscribe part from it. Please don't advertise the list's direct
address so we won't get spammed. Thanks.

You can generate diffs with:

% svn diff filename(s)

Send the commits aligned in the body of the message so we can comment on
them. Unless your browser mangles formatted text. Thanks!

If you are interested in helping us creating great documentation by
reviewing what gets committed and submitting new docs and patches,
please subscribe to these two mailing list.

Welcome to the yet another cool project brought to you by Apache
Software Foundation.
