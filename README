This is mod_perl 2.0 docs documentation project repository

The repository is called modperl-docs, but it'll be automatically
placed into modperl-2.0/docs when you check out mod_perl-2.0. So you
can get the repository in one of these ways:

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login

password: anoncvs

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co modperl-2.0

and then look in modperl-2.0/docs or:

 % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co modperl-docs

The documentation CVS snapshots (rolled every 6 hours) can be
downloaded from http://cvs.apache.org/snapshots/modperl-docs/, the
same repository now is a part of the modperl-2.0 checkout in the
modperl-2.0/docs directory.

You probably want to subscribe to these two mailing lists:

docs-cvs-subscribe@perl.apache.org
docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org

The first one is for cvs commits and the second is for discussions.

Then you can post to the modperl-docs discussion list. To post take
the docs-dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org address and remove the
-subscribe part from it. Please don't advertise the list's direct
address so we won't get spammed. Thanks.

Currently there are no searchable/browsable mailing list archives, but
the raw mbox-format archives can be downloaded from:

  http://perl.apache.org/mail/docs-dev
  http://perl.apache.org/mail/docs-cvs

There is also rsync interface for those who want to keep local mirrors
and hopefull offload the main apache.org servers:

  rsync://cvs.apache.org/modperl-docs     modperl-docs CVS tree, exported  (updated 4x/day)
  rsync://cvs.apache.org/modperl-docs-cvs modperl-docs CVS Repository.

If you are interested in helping us creating great documentation by
reviewing what gets committed and submitting new docs and patches,
please subscribe to these two mailing list.

Welcome to the yet another cool project brought to you by Apache
Software Foundation.
